00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.015
The purpose of an antenna is to send and receive the radar signal.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:11.400
The frequency of our given time is recorded,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.714
and this is used to determine the distance and velocity.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:20.295
The antenna in general is composed of several patches.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:25.170
The difference in signal received between

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.880
different patches is used to compute the reflected angle.

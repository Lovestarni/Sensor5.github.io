00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.954
In order to detect objects,

00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:10.394
usually a radar is composed of the following parts;

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:15.719
a component that produces electromagnetic waves,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.545
and antenna used for transmitting and receiving the radar signal,

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:30.650
and a receiver, and processing model for detecting the object properties.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.390
In the simple description,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.200
that transmitted waves reflect off the target,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.435
and return back to the sensor.

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:44.600
Then the received signal is used to compute objects radial distance,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.179
radial velocity, and angles.

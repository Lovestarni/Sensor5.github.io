00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
So far, we have learned how radar generates

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.849
the signals and the factors that impact the signal propagation.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:11.039
Now we will look into how a target and properties impact the radar detection.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.699
Ever wondered what makes the stealth aircraft go undetected?

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.664
The answer is RCS.

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:18.614
But what is RCS?

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:21.119
Radar Cross Section is defined as the size and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.330
ability of a target to reflect radar energy.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.844
It is measured in meter square and depends on the following criteria.

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:32.250
Number 1, the direction of the illuminating radar.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.895
That is, the angle at which the radar beam hits the target.

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:40.470
Different angle of elimination will have different returns signal strength.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.365
Number 2, radars transmitter frequency.

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:46.440
Higher the frequency, smaller the wavelength of the signal,

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:49.125
and more will be the RCS of the target.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.284
Number 3, material reuse in cars, trucks,

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:58.384
bicycles, and some cases even the clothing material for pedestrians.

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:00.619
Number 4, the most important,

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.875
targets physical geometry and exterior features.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.894
Let's say if a target has smooth edges or surface,

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:09.364
then it would scatter waves in all directions.

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:13.414
Hence, only a part of the signal gets reflected back to the radar.

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:16.145
This leads to a lower RCS.

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:19.399
Sharp corners will focus the return signal back in

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.940
the direction of the source leading to higher RCS.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.349
We can see this clearly depicted by the images of different target geometries.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:32.334
So as you can see, the sphere reflects the signal in all the directions.

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:38.119
But here, a corner reflector focuses all the energy back to the radar.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.800
Here we have a table showing the RCS of different targets. Point to note.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.884
Higher the RCS, stronger return signal from the target.

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:49.685
Hence, higher the probability of detection.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:54.665
So a small corner reflector because of its shape can be detected far in the range,

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:58.109
whereas at truck may go undetected.

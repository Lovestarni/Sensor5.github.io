00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
Now, let's take a look at the complete hardware implementation,

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:05.655
and learn the functionality of each component.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.009
Let's start with the transmitter side.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.529
First one, the frequency synthesizer.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.799
It is the component that generates transmit frequency of the signal.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.995
The strength of the signal generated is too low at this stage,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.670
hence a power amplifier is used to amplify the signal.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.655
The right amount of amplification helps a radar to sense the target at long distances.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.500
Next is an antenna.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.809
An antenna is an important component.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.719
The antenna converts electrical energy into

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.854
electromagnetic waves which radiate through the air,

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:38.189
go hit the target,

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:40.349
and then gets reflected back towards the radar,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.795
receiver, antenna right here.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:44.870
An antenna also help increase the strength of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.884
the signal by focusing the energy in the desired direction.

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:49.744
Moving onto the mixer now.

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.039
In FMCW Radar, the mixer multiplies

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.089
the return signal with the sweeping signal generated by the frequency synthesizer.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.680
The operation works as frequency subtraction to give the frequency Delta,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.375
also known as frequency shift,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.569
intermediate frequency, or beat frequency.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:09.844
Last is the brain of the radar or its processor.

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:14.403
The processing unit is responsible for carrying out all the digital signal processing,

00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:19.609
detection, tracking, clustering, and other algorithms.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.694
It is generally implemented on the microcontroller or FPGA.

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:25.889
Let's see what do we have here.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.474
The elimination zones of the radar.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:31.714
The one in the green is from the short-range radar,

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:35.329
and orange is from the long range radar.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.409
These elimination zones are dependent on the antenna pattern.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.554
What is an antenna pattern?

00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:46.175
An antenna pattern is a geometric pattern of the strength of its electric field.

00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:49.840
Let's look further how it impacts radar perception.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.659
As you can see in this image,

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.899
an antenna pattern has one main beam and

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.560
several other small beams which are called as the side lobes.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.025
The main beam is responsible for detecting the targets.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:05.359
The beam width of the main-lobe determines the field of view for the radar sensor.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.655
So if the requirement for the radar is to just sense the targets in its own lane,

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.039
then the beam width needs to be small.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.294
If the beam is wider than the lane width,

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:19.114
it will sense the targets and other lanes as well.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:22.460
The antenna side lobes are undesirable because they can

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.659
generate false alarms and pick indifference from undesired direction.

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.159
As seen in the pattern,

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.020
the side lobes of the antenna point in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.005
different directions and can sense targets set out in the main beam.

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:35.949
The wide side lobe detection,

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.329
it is critical to suppress the side lobe levels.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
So far, we have learned enough to calculate the maximum range a radar can detect.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.140
Let's check that out. This equation here gives the maximum range of a radar sensor.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.510
It is depended on many factors.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.615
It is directly proportional to the transmit power,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.699
gain of the antennas,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.964
wavelength of the signal,

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:22.620
and target radar cross section.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.660
The maximum range reduces if the minimum detected signal at the receiver increases.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.100
Now, I will leave it to you to calculate the max range in the next exercise.

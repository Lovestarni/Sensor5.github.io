00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.310
In our case we use a mixture of

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:10.304
short and long-range radars built specifically for this project.

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:11.939
In the context of automotive,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:13.980
the radars are required to use

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.865
only a specific frequency bandwidth designated for automotive use.

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.474
Here their requirements are different.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:27.660
For example, the automotive radars are cost-driven,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.859
small, and with less power consumption.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.399
It should not contain moving parts.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.310
The detection range is less than what we need for example in defense or weather purposes.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.285
It's hard to say what is the range of

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:53.989
automotive radar because there are different variants.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.060
Let's say long-range radars can reliably see

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.359
objects up to 250 meters but they have a small field of view.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:08.343
On the other side there are radars,

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:12.019
short range radars that are designated to

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:17.399
have larger field of view but they cannot see as far.

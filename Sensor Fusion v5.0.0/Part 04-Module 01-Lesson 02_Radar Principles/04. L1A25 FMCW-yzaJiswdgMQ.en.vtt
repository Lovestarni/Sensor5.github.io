00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
So now I assume you have a good understanding of radio waves and its properties.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:05.820
School physics, right?

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.885
Okay. So next we look into the hardware implementation of the radar system.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.849
Since W or frequency modulated

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.114
continuous wave radar is the most commonly used radar for automotive applications.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.179
Its ability to measure range and velocity simultaneously,

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:27.539
it's low cost, and simple hardware implementation make it a first choice radar.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.304
Let's have a look what exactly is FMCW radar.

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:34.950
Here's an important part, the saw-tooth signal.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.804
FMCW is a continuously transmitting signal

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.625
in which the frequency changes linearly with time.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:45.259
Each time that you see in the plot is called FMCW chirp.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:50.089
These chirps are defined by their bandwidth and chirp time or sweep time.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.910
If we divide the bandwidth by chirp time,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.359
you get the slope of the linear signal.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.755
Red chirp is the transmitted signal,

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:00.850
blue is the received signal,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.445
which is nothing but the time delayed version of the transmitted signal.

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:08.179
Further in the course, you will learn how this small shift in the signal will

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.900
determine the range and velocity of the target. So hold tight.

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.799
Some of the limitations of the radars is that they are not

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.509
able to precisely provide the object shapes,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.990
and also we can say that the radars are

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.240
not suitable for classification tasks as in the case of cameras.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:33.570
Well, the lidars are known by the fact that they can provide a more accurate position,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.289
information and shape information,

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.570
while the radars are used to get the motion information,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.365
and by combining the measurements provided by both of these sensors,

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:55.300
would lead to a more robust and more complete object representations.

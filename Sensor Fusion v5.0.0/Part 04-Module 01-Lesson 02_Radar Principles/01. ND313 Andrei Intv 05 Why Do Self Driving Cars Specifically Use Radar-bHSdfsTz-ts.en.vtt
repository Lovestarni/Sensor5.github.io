00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.899
Supplying parse contain a lot of sensors and

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.460
every sensor has its own strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.565
Basically, we use radars to compensate over the weaknesses of the other sensors.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:23.820
One of the biggest advantages of radar is it measures the radial velocity directly.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.609
While other sensors need to calculate velocities by using derivatives,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.914
the radar can determine the rate of velocity instantly.

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:39.575
This also helps to distinguish between the stationary and moving objects.

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:45.545
Another big advantage is that the radar is less influenced,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.380
less biased by the environment conditions.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.955
It can work day and night unlike cameras,

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:59.109
and it can work in rainy or snowy conditions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Let us familiarize ourselves with the radar.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.970
Radars have been in use since 1930's,

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.419
when they were primarily used by the military to detect enemy aircraft.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.050
Since then, radar technology has come a long way.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.664
Today radars are increasingly being used as automotive sensor for

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:20.429
advanced driver systems and self-driving initiators.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.870
Advancements in the RF technology and digital signal processing have made it

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.730
possible to design efficient radars at low cost and in miniature size.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.664
The radar's capability to determine the targets at long range with accurate velocity

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:39.810
and spatial information makes it an important sensor for self-driving applications.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.550
Its capability to sense objects in

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.229
dark and poor weather condition also helps it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.500
cover the shortcomings of lidar and camera sensors.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.895
Hey, check this out,

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.565
"The 40-year-old challenge for automotive radars."

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:57.184
Today, most of the cars are equipped with radar sensors for adaptive cruise control,

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:00.260
too close warnings, and side car detections.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.229
But the future self-driving cars would be using more and more of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.414
these sensors to generate a complete awareness of the surroundings.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.145
As you can see in the image,

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:11.469
for level 4 and 5 autonomy,

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.069
a radar will not just detect but will also classify targets.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.069
Hence, generating high resolution imaging.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.744
Okay, so first things first.

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:23.520
How does the radar work?

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:26.329
A radar emits electromagnetic waves.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.495
These waves are reflected if they meet an obstacle.

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:34.195
After reflection, when they are received again at their place of origin,

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.939
that shows that there is an obstacle in the propagation direction.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.174
The frequency of electromagnetic energy use for radar is unaffected by darkness.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:46.429
It penetrates through flog and clouds.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.390
This permits radar system to determine the position of road targets,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.924
that are invisible to the naked eye because of distance, darkness, or weather.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:02:00.215
The same principle allows the cars of today to have adaptive cruise control.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:05.930
Using the radar, a car can autonomously maintain its distance as well as speed,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.064
and can apply brakes to avoid collisions.

00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:11.944
Okay, so here's an actual commercial radar,

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:14.314
a long-range radar from Bosch.

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:16.039
Do you see how tiny it is?

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.709
The black covering on the top is the radium that

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.045
makes the radar weather proof without impacting its performance.

00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:27.054
Then, we have the printed circuit board which houses the antenna and RF assemblies.

00:02:27.055 --> 00:02:30.284
Under that is a Digital Signal Processing Unit.

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:33.905
Check this out, a radar chip-set. Yes, that's right.

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:36.395
You can hold it between your fingertips.

00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:39.655
Getting to the hottest debate in the self-driving world.

00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:41.680
Lidar or radar?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.094
One can find many articles comparing lidar and radar.

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:48.604
But really, these sensors are kind of complimentary to each other.

00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:53.104
It is true that lidar can generate a high resolution imaging and radar cannot,

00:02:53.104 --> 00:02:56.829
but radar gives you a highly accurate velocity estimation.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.395
Where lidar fails in bad weather conditions like rain or fog,

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:03.650
radar due to its wavelength size is never hindered by the weather.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.575
A major concern with lidar is its cost.

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:10.339
A lidar can cost a car manufacturer more than a couple of grands,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.955
while radar sets them back by a few $100 only.

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:18.060
No more wondering why [inaudible] doesn't like lidar.

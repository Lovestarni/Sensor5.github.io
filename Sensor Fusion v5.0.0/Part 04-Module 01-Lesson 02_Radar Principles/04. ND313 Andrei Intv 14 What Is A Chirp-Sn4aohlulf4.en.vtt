A chirp is a radar signal whose frequency is increasing or decreasing in time.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.615
So the signal with increasing frequency are known as up-chirp,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.230
and the ones with decreasing frequency are known as down-chirp.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.660
Some of the radars use repeated chirp signals to compute both distance and velocity.

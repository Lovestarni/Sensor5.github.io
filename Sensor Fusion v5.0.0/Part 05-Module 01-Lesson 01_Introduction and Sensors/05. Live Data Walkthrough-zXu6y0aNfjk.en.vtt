00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.569
Let me show you some real measurements,
so you can get a sense for

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.823
the way radar and
LiDAR detect the world.

00:00:05.823 --> 00:00:10.083
This is a LiDAR point cloud,
you can see a person over here.

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:12.766
&gt;&gt; That's me, that's me.

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:16.143
&gt;&gt; This is output from
our fusion system.

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:19.653
You can see how the dots
capture David's shape.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:24.379
The lines you see are the laser
scan layers bouncing off his body.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:29.064
The common filters that you will
build will take light up point clouds

00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:33.109
like this and use them to track
objects in the environment.

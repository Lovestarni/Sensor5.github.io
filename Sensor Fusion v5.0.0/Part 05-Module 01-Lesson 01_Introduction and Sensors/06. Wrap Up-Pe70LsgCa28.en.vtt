00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.130
Thanks for the walk-through,
that is a pretty cool car.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.839
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.810
We're proud of Chewbacca, but
hardware is changing all the time.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.429
Finding the best sensor solution
is an open and ongoing problem.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.339
We'll be updating Chewbacca
as hardware improves.

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.079
Sensor fusion is only as
useful as the hardware itself.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.619
More data means less uncertainty
in the position of nearby objects.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.289
As hardware gets cheaper,

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.379
we'll improve our ability to
model the world with more data.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.640
&gt;&gt; Coming up next, you'll build
common filters with Sebastian.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.189
If you've taken Sebastian's AI for

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:40.199
Robotics class recently, feel free
to skip ahead to the C++ checkpoint.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.170
Otherwise, have fun.

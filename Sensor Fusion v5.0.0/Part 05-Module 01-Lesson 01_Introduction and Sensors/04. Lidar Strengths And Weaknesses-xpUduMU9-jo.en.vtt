00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.812
LIDAR stands for Light Detection and
Ranging, just as RADAR stands for

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.748
RAdio Detection And Ranging.

00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:11.657
Unlike RADAR, which uses radio waves,
LIDAR uses an infrared laser

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:16.759
beam to determine the distance between
the sensor and a nearby object.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.710
Most current LIDARs use light in the 900
nanometer wavelength range, although

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.820
some LIDARs use longer wavelengths,
which perform better in rain and fog.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.559
In current LIDARs,

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.989
a rotating swivel scans the laser
beam across the field of view.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.920
The lasers are pulsed, and
the pulses are reflected by objects.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.880
These reflections return a point
cloud that represents these objects.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.410
LIDAR has a much higher
spatial resolution than RADAR

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.739
because of the more focused laser beam,
the larger number of scan layers in

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.469
the vertical direction, and the high
density of LIDAR points per layer.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.350
The current generation of LIDARs
cannot measure the velocity of objects

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.500
directly.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.200
And have to rely on the differing
position between two or more scans.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.310
LIDARs are also more affected
by weather conditions and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.219
by dirt on the sensor,
which requires keeping them clean.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.390
They are also much bulkier than
other sensors and therefore,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.019
more difficult to integrate unless
one just wants to mount a big scanner

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:21.609
on the roof of the vehicle.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.123
So how do we apply LIDAR and RADAR?

00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:25.000
Let me show you.

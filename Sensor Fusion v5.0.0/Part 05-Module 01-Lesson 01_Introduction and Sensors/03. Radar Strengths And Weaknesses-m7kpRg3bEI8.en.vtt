00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.900
This is a prototype self-driving
car that we've been working on.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.419
We call it Chewbacca.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.050
And all around it, we've embedded
about 15 different sensors.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.929
Let me show you a few.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.019
This is a stereo camera.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.100
The two cameras together, work just
like our eyes to form a stereo image

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.679
that allows us to gather both image
data, as well as distance information.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.489
This is a camera for
the recognition of traffic signals.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.570
Often, traffic signals can be located on
the other side of an intersection, so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.920
we use a special lens to give
the camera sufficient range

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.679
to detect the signal from far away.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.070
This is a radar, and
it sits behind the front bumper like so.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.030
Radars have in automobiles for years.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.520
You can find them in systems
like adaptive cruise control,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.600
blind spot warning, collision
warning and collision avoidance.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.590
Even though radar is
a mature technology,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.080
it still gets improved all the time
to make it even more powerful.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.129
While other sensors measure velocity
by calculating the difference between

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.450
two readings,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.390
radar uses something called the Doppler
effect to measure speed directly.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.510
The Doppler effect measures the change
in frequency of the radar waves

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.570
based on whether the object is
moving away from you or toward you.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.429
This is kind of like how a fire
engine siren will sound differently

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.110
depending on whether the fire engine
is moving away from you or toward you.

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.750
The Doppler effect is important for

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.930
sensor fusion because it gives us
the velocity as an independent measure

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.190
parameter, and it makes the fusion
algorithms converge much faster.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.570
Radar can also be used for

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.359
localization by generating
radar maps of the environment.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.689
Because radar waves
bounce off hard surfaces,

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.149
they can provide measurements to
objects without direct line of flight.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.260
Radar can see underneath other vehicles,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.410
and spot buildings and objects
that would be obscured otherwise.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.379
Of all the sensors on the car, radar is
the least affected by rain or fog and

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:04.659
can have a wide field of view,
about 150 degrees, or

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.518
a long range, 200 plus meters.

00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:10.960
Compared to lidars and cameras,
radars have a low resolution.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.210
Especially in the vertical direction,
the resolution is very limited.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.290
The lower resolution also means that
reflections from static objects can

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.459
cause problems.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.469
For example, manhole covers or
a soda can lying on the street

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.740
can have high radar reflectivity even
though they are relatively small.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.730
This is called radar clutter, and

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:35.119
it's why current automotive radars
usually disregard static objects.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.900
Next up, let me show you a lidar.

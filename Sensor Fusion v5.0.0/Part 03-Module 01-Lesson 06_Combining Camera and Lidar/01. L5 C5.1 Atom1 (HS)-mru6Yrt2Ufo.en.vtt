00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
Now, welcome to this lesson, which is the last one before the final project.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.960
Now that you have successfully completed the first three lessons in the course,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.474
as well as the midterm project,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.679
you now know how keypoint matching works and how it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.839
can be used to compute the time to collision.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.390
In this lesson, we will focus on two major aspects.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.179
The first one is you will learn how to combine camera and

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.399
light up by projecting 3D points onto the image plane,

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.529
then you will average deep learning to detect vehicles in the camera image which is

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.700
a mandatory prerequisite for clustering the latter point Cloud into separate objects.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.004
Then the final project,

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.899
you will need those skills to code the last part of this course,

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.339
which is the actual tracking of 3D objects through space.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.730
In this section, we will start with displaying and cropping Lidar points in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.779
a top view perspective and then look at how to project 3D points onto the image plane.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.609
What you will need is a fair amount of math to

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.085
understand all the aspects of the transformation equations.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:53.725
So you might want to refresh on linear algebra especially matrix-vector operations.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.200
Once you have completed this section,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.890
you can visualize Lidar points within the camera image,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.954
which is a powerful tool when it comes to understanding and performing sensor fusion.

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:04.129
So let's start right away into this last lesson.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.659
See you soon, down below.

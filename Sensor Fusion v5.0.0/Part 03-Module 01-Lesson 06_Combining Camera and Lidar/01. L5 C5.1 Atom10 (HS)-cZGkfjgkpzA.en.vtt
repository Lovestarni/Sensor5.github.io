00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
You've really covered some ground on the section,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.334
starting with a top view perspectives for lidar,

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:05.969
moving on to homogeneous coordinates,

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:08.714
and calibration matrices, and projection equations.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:12.449
You have succeeded in visualizing and in filtering nano data.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.849
This will help us a lot very shortly when we combine

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.489
2D camera key points with 3D lidar points.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.239
But first, let's take a look at the next section where we'll make use of deep learning

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:26.140
to detect vehicles and some other things in camera images. See you there.

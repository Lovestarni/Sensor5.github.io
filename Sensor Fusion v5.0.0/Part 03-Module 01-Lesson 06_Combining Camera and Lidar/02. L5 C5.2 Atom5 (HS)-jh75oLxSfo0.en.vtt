00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
So now that you know how YOLO works,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.649
let's play around with some of its parameters.

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.299
In this exercise, please complete the following tasks.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.390
The first is, find out which classes YOLO is able to detect

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.705
and use some images of your own to see what the network makes of them.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:15.750
If you like, share some of your results with us, please.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.460
The second is, experiment with the size of the blob image,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.750
and try to find a decent trade-off between execution time on the one hand,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.640
and detection results on the other hand.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.675
Finally, third step, experiment with a thresholds on both confidence,

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:31.245
and the non-maxima suppression to see how detection results change.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.550
Now, the overarching theme with

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.789
all three exercises here is to develop a feel for how YOLO performs,

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.780
and how it is affected by parameter settings.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.840
Once you are finished, feel free to proceed to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.090
the next section of this lesson. See you there shortly.

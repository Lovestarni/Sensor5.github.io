00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Now one of the major advantages of the YOLO framework is its speed.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.310
In contrast to other methods,

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.830
it only makes a single pass through the neural network,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.050
hence the name, You Only Look Once,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.310
or YOLO for short.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.304
When you compare YOLO to its peers,

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.029
the results are quite decent actually.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.839
Also you can download a set of pre-trained weights directly from the developers,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.179
and use it right out of the box and it works.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.835
In this section, we will take a look at the workflow of YOLO.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:26.820
What you will learn is, you will learn how to initialize the parameters,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.740
prepare the model and the data structures,

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.199
run the actual forward pass through the network,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.200
and finally do some post processing of the results.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.000
This will not be a deep dive here,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.564
we only want to use YOLO as a means to an end.

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:40.515
We need bounding boxes around vehicles,

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.270
and this is what we will get from the network.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.070
Now let's see how this actually works.

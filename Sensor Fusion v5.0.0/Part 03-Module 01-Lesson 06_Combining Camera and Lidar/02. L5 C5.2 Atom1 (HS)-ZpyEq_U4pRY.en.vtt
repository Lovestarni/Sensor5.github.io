00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.439
Now, this section, we will use

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.339
a deep learning approach to detect vehicles in camera images,

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:05.900
and the context of a code framework,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.290
this is a really important step.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.929
For now, we have matched key points all over the image and we have

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.320
lidar points covering the entire scene in front of the sensor.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.699
We now know how to remove some of the data we do not need by filtering,

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.689
but this will not be sufficient to identify individual vehicles,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.770
and compute the TTC which is the ultimate goal in this course.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.079
To get there, we need to group both key points and lidar points,

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.619
and associate them to the vehicles present in the scene.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.450
Now, by using object detection,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.200
we get a set of rectangles or bounding boxes around all vehicles in the scene,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.260
and with these, we can unite camera and lidar.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.059
Let's take a look at the program flow schematic

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.070
to see where we are, and where we need to go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.259
Now, welcome to the last section in this lesson.

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:04.250
Once you're done here, you will start with a final project,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.370
but before we get there,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.410
let's discuss a few more concepts you may need.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.289
Now, the first thing we focus on would be the task of grouping

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.729
lidar points based on the regions of interests we get from the other framework,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.080
and then we'll briefly look at a way to

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.914
avoid grouping lidar points which belong to different objects.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:20.344
Based on this initial grouping,

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:22.119
we will assemble a set of 3D objects,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.710
and extract a set of properties such as distance to the closest point,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.210
the number of supporting lidar points,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.265
as well as the object width in meters.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:30.615
Once we're finished with that,

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.969
we have a set of 3D objects for every time step,

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.549
so that means for every tenth of a second.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.029
The final project, you will shortly be using

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.530
key point matches between images to connect those 3D objects and time,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.685
and to compute the time to collision for them.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:44.810
So let's jump right in,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.490
and then move on to the final project.

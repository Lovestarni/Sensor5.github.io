00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.404
I think it still makes a lot of sense to learn

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.929
the classical computer vision algorithms like half transforms,

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.150
color spaces, edge detection.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.370
Not everything has to be done with deep learning.

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.890
You can also think about teaching basic math.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.039
Do you want to stop teaching linear algebra

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.469
just because computers can do it for us today now?

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:28.199
I don't think so. I think it's

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.625
okay to pre-train neural networks with

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:37.424
simulated data because you can just have a vast amount of data to pre-train,

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:41.089
but it's really hard to simulate the characteristics and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.260
noise models precisely to the chip that you want to have in your target vehicle.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:48.829
So you will not get around by just training and simulation.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.905
You will have to add annotated real data on top,

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:56.340
but for pre-training, I think right now it's already pretty usable.

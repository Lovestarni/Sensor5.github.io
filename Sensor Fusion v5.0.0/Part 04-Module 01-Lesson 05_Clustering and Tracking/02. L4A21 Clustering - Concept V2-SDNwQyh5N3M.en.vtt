00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
First, why do we need the clustering algorithm?

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.595
For the automotive sensors,

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:08.564
there is a need to track multiple targets simultaneously.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:11.355
Tracking an object is computationally expensive.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.700
So it is important to make sure that only valid targets are being

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.300
tracked and no tracks get assigned to individual detections.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.155
With the advancements in radar technology and increasing sensing resolutions,

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:26.865
our radar can generate detections from pointitude of scattering points on the target.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:29.219
For successful tracking, there is a need to

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.814
cluster all the detections from a single target,

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.990
and that is why we need a clustering algorithm.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.560
Here, we will discuss the basic clustering algorithm based on the Euclidean distance.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.480
The algorithm here enables the grouping of the detection points

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.919
based on their proximity measure by the Euclidean distance between them.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.280
All the detection points that are within the size of the target are

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.225
considered clusters and are merged into the single centroid.

00:00:56.225 --> 00:01:00.545
This illustration shows the importance of clustering in tracking scenario.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.490
In the image, the blue car is a legal vehicle,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.530
it's a vehicle with the sensor and the detections are

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.040
generated from the orange and yellow vehicles.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.220
Using clustering algorithm, all the detections

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.594
associated with the single target are merged at one point.

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:20.400
This helps in detection and keeping track of targets.

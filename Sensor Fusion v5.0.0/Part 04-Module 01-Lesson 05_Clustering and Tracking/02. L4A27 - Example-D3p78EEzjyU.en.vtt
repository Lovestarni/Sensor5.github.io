00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.415
Let's see how to implement a clustering algorithm.

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:07.169
We'll walk through a clustering function part of Matlab's object tracking simulator.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.280
For this, we need the list of radar detections and vehicle size.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.699
If the detections are from the same sensor and loop through

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.844
every single detection point and measure the Euclidean distance between all of them,

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:24.210
then initialize a vector to hold the detection clusters.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.539
Keep running the loop until the detection list is empty.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.765
Now, implement the falling within the while loop,

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:34.844
pick the first detection in the checklist and put it under consideration.

00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:37.320
If the distance between the first pick and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.230
remaining detections is less than the vehicle size,

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.299
then group those detections and their respective radar sensor measurements,

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.134
including creating range and velocity.

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:50.824
For the group, take the mean of the range and velocity measurements.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.440
The radar measurement vector has six values.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.960
Where range and velocity for X and Y coud It's reside at 1,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.255
2, and 4,5 respectively.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.295
Create a new cluster id then assign all the group detections to the same id.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.370
Further, assign cluster the mean range

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.070
and velocity that were calculated in the previous step.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.539
In the end, delete from

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.275
the list detections which have already been assigned to a cluster.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:19.520
Keep repeating the process until the detection list is empty.

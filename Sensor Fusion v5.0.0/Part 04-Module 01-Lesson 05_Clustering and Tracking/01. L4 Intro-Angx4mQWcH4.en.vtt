00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.024
Welcome to our last lesson.

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:05.179
Here we will go through some more post processing techniques.

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:07.115
We will look into clustering algorithm,

00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:10.740
which is important for our radar to make sense out of its detection.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.605
Then we will touch base with common tracking.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.570
Later in this lesson's workspace,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
we'll walk through a MATLAB sensors fusion code and learn how to implement that.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.330
Let's get started.

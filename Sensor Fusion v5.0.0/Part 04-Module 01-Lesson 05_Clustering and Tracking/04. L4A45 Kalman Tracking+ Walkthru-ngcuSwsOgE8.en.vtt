00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.334
Since we already looked into the main implementation for this workspace,

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:06.794
let's walk through the complete code.

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:10.195
The first part of the code is imported from the Matlab striving

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:14.745
toolbox where you can define and generate your own driving and targets scenarios.

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:16.329
Using the same toolbox,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.799
we can generate radar sensor profiles.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.370
Once the road scenarios and sensor profiles are integrated,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.400
then the implement object tracking on degenerate scenario.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:27.619
The object tracking here will utilize

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.734
that clustering algorithm and common tracking that we reviewed in the previous videos.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.554
Now it's time to run the code and see the output.

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:37.368
But before we do that,

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:40.865
I would definitely recommend spending some time on the sense efficient code.

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:45.390
It's a good place to start learning and implementing sensor fusion techniques.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
So this is where we define the road scenario.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:08.415
This comes from the driving toolbox and here,

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.079
we define the different actors.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.589
When I say actors, that means the different vehicles on the road.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.045
You can generate this output in the driving toolbox.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:22.665
After that, we define the configuration for sensors.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:25.320
In this case we are using six sensors on

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.460
the legal vehicle and each of them has the parameters defined in the driving toolbox.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.634
So you can go into the driving toolbox,

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:37.605
you can pick different configuration for each sensor,

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.329
and you can mount it on the car.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.350
This is where the main loop begins.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.310
So here you can see the tracker takes a detections from their radar sensors

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.030
and it run it through the tracker function as well as

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.995
the clustering function to generate the confirm tracks.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.949
The clustering function is the same function that we looked

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.355
through and it is defined over here.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:14.650
This is where you define the common filter based on your motion model.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.859
A common filter after being defined goes into

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:25.629
this multi-object tracker and this is where the tracker is generated.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.439
Using all this once we run the code,

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.459
we get the output in this format.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.560
So as you can see, the car in blue is a legal vehicle.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.984
It has six sensors around it, the radar sensors.

00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:46.924
Now you can see on the yellow car as it passes by,

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:50.379
it's detecting multiple points.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:56.109
The one in the black square in the circle is the tracker.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.565
So let's go ahead and move on to the next step, and that's clustering.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:13.440
So now we want to be able to cluster these obstacles into different- basically,

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.199
we want to figure out all the unique vehicles on the road so we can track them over time,

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.239
predict how they're going to be moving,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.679
feed that to the sensor fusion pipeline with the radar information,

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.660
and be able to have some estimation for how those objects are moving in our space.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.409
So here are the results of clustering;

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.484
this alternating between three colors,

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:40.875
with these red, yellow, and blue.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.270
So next, you're just going to go ahead and call

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.070
that clustering function to go ahead and try out some different parameters.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.030
You might remember, what are the parameters for doing our clustering here.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.560
Well, that big one was the distance tolerance that we're working with.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.829
Then also, we have these additional ones for setting a min and max size clusters.

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.700
So maybe we can make some use of out of that here where we're seeing some points.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.594
It's scattered off in the edge.

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:17.539
Maybe we can use some of those hyper parameters with min size to clean those up,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.380
or maybe there's something we can do with that distance tolerance as well.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Congratulations for making it through the entire lighter obstacle detection pipeline.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.390
You now have everything in your toolbox needed in order to do this project,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.750
for identifying where vehicles are at on the cityscape environment.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.870
Here you'll be working with filtering, segmentation,

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.300
and clustering techniques, to identify

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.940
where these vehicles are at on a cityscape environment.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.240
The resources needed for doing this project can be found in the classroom,

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.789
where you can find the rubric and all the details.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.369
I hope you enjoy this project and good luck.

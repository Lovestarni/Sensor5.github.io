00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's do the steps for obstacle detection now.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.885
So we did filtering.

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:09.375
Now, you can actually use all the functions that you were creating in previous lessons.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.879
So the next step is to segment the data and then here,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.560
that shows the results when you do the segmentation.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:19.289
So it's going to segment it and then all these green points

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.064
are the drivable area, the flat space,

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:26.370
the road and then all of these red points or other points that are not

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.839
belonging to that flat area and that's going to be obstacles that we're interested in.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.710
So that's picking out our truck and our parked cars and our pole.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.664
Also showing this purple box region.

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:44.750
So that's actually, what I did is I figured out what kind of size box,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.799
the minimum size box.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.529
I needed to figure out points that

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.145
contain all the points from the roof of the car that I wanted to filter out.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:53.780
Then once I got that box size,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.715
I'm just rendering it here in purple.

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:59.990
I was passing into that filter Cloud function and using

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.629
that combination of the crop box and they extract object to remove those points.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.824
So that's showing how you could visually do that.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:11.870
Visually use the render box function to help you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.910
remove points such as points from hitting the roof of your ego car.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.905
This sets it up for the project.

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:06.135
This is the project here where you're working for data one.

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:08.939
Basically you're just trying to get results like this,

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.084
where you can get bounding boxes around these parked cars and this truck passing you.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:18.210
Then for the segmentation and clustering functions,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.550
what you're actually going to be using is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.890
the code that we were talking about in the previous lessons,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.065
so you'll be implementing these from scratch.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:31.679
In those lessons we're telling you how to do that and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.420
basically you remember you're actually implementing RANSAC from scratch,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.760
and that's how you're able to do the segmentation.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:42.219
Then you're also implementing your own k-d tree,

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.339
and then implementing including clustering,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.609
so you can use that code to process this and do the clustering yourself.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.909
That's what the final project will entail.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:59.049
Then, yes, it's trying to get results that look like this and capture the scene.

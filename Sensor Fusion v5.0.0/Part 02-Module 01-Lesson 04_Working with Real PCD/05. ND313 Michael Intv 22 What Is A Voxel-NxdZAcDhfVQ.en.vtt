A voxel is a 3D pixel,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.759
or it's called a volume pixel.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.050
Have you ever played Minecraft, right?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.995
So each of those blocks is actually a voxel,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:26.804
and therefore uses a lot less memory to describe it,

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:29.920
then you would have to use otherwise.

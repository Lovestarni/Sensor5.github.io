00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.734
Some of the challenges that emerge using lidar in the real-world,

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:13.559
come from environmental conditions.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.960
So lidar does not do well in heavy rain,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.615
in whiteouts, in brownouts,

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:30.195
where dirt is, whether you have lots of dirt in the air like in Southern California,

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.789
you find sand storms.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.644
Anything that reflects and scatters lidar,

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:41.910
the laser beams in the air limits the use of the lidar.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:48.254
You also create sometimes ghost objects based on reflections.

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:51.395
If you have a highly reflecting surface,

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:56.010
the lidar beam reflects off the surface, hits the vehicle,

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.449
gets reflected back surface,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.920
and back to the lidar,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.600
you create a ghost objects,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.594
or objects where there is no one;

00:01:04.594 --> 00:01:06.724
there is no object really.

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:12.829
You get lidar returns, for example,

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.890
from a spray, we saw ones on the test track.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.379
It suddenly start raining really hard,

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:26.149
and then we had all weird objects,

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.954
and that was just the water that was spraying up from the tires from other cars.

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:37.239
So that's the difficulty that you face.

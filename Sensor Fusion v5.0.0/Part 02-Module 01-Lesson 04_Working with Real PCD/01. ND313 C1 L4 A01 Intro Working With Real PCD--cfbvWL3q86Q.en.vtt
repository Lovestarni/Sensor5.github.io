00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
Hey everyone, and welcome to this lesson

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.070
where we'll be working with real point Cloud Data.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.690
In the previous lessons,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.005
you learned how to segment and cluster simple simulate point clouds.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.610
Now you'll learn how to apply

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:15.449
these same skills to actual Point Cloud Data from a self-driving car.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.480
You'll also learn how to do additional filtering techniques,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.835
and create a pipeline to perform obstacle detection across multiple streaming PCD files.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:29.530
So let's get started by loading up some actual Point Cloud Data from a self-driving car.

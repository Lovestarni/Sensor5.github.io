We down-sample lidar data because sending out the entire point cloud

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:17.730
over an internal vehicle network, that's a lot of data.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.505
So what we do is actually we convert the point cloud into stixels.

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:26.219
Like what we do with the stereo cameras,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.410
stixels' basically like a matchstick.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.320
So if you have the back of a vehicle,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.429
then the stixels would be putting a bunch of

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:44.825
matchsticks to hover the trunk or cover the vehicle,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.820
and this gives you two things.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.920
Number 1, the number of matchsticks.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.615
Each one is, let's say,

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:54.859
four inches wide gives you the width of the vehicle,

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.829
and the height of the matchsticks gives you the height of the vehicle,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.309
but you do not need anything in between.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.109
You just need the height and the width,

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:08.689
and this makes everything that reduces the data a lot,

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.269
and makes things actually easier to work with.

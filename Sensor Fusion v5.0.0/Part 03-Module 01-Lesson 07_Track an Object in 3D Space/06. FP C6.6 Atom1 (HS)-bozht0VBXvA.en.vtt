00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Now, the last task of the final project is about conducting tests and

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.605
about finding the best parameter settings in all the different stages of the algorithm.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.975
I would like you to do the following; the first is,

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:12.300
look for several examples where you have the impression that

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.760
the lidar-based TTC estimate is way off.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.019
Once you have found those,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.359
describe the observations and also provide

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.984
a sound argumentation why you think this happened.

00:00:20.984 --> 00:00:24.169
The second is, run several combinations of detectors and descriptors,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.775
and look at the differences in TTC estimation.

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:28.320
Find out which methods perform best,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.820
and also include several examples where camera-based TTC estimation is way off.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.159
As with lidar, describe the observations again,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.844
and also look into potential reasons for this.

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:39.929
This is the last task and the final project.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.310
We are super excited to receiving your submission as soon as possible.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Welcome to lesson 4.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:06.285
So far we have learned the basic principles of radar operation,

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:08.414
then we worked on determining the range,

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:12.524
and upper information about the targets by implementing the FFT techniques.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.554
In this lesson, we will discuss clutter noise,

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.509
and look into how it leads to detection failures.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.110
We will learn about the implementation of CFAR technique to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.844
dynamically filter the noise and decrease the rate of false alarms,

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:28.439
and at the end, we will look into how radar

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.455
determines the angle of arrival for different targets.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:35.879
So let's begin. There have been scenarios where cars equipped with

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.120
emergency braking systems applied sudden breaks due

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.625
to their radar sensing strong reflections of the road surface,

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.780
or of any invalid target.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.600
These reflections create false alarm making

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.329
the radar considered them as well the targets.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.339
Let's learn how these false positives are generated and how to tackle them.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.300
Radar not only receives reflected signals from the objects of interest,

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.844
but also from unwanted objects and the environment.

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:06.635
The back-scatter from these unwanted sources is called as clutter.

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:10.475
These unwanted signals are generally produced by reflections from the ground,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:15.064
sea, buildings, trees, rain, fog, etc.

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:17.224
It also varies based on the texture.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:20.339
For example, deserts have low reflectivity,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.670
where as frozen snow has higher reflectivity.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.980
Generally, an absolute noise thresholding is

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.530
implemented for radar to reject the signal below threshold value.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.390
But there are issues associated with the absolute threshold.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.450
Let's say if detection threshold is set too high,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.534
there will be few false alarms,

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:45.579
but it will also match well the targets just like the target here at a 125 meters.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.920
If the threshold is set too low,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.545
then it would lead to too many false alarms.

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:52.379
What is false alarm rate?

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.939
The false alarm rate is a measure of the presence of

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.209
radar target when there is no valid target present.

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.609
It is the function of signal to noise ratio of

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.465
the target such that higher is the signal to noise ratio,

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:07.010
lower is the false alarm rate.

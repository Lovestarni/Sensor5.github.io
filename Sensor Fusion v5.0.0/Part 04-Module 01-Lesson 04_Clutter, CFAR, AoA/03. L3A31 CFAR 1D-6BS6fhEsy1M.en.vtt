00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
As seen in the previous concept,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.070
fixed thresholding is not an optimal solution.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.214
Hence, we have CFAR,

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:09.660
constant false alarm rate, or CFAR,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.030
is the solution to keep the false alarm rates lower without missing that valid targets.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.995
Let's see how CFAR works.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.925
CFAR varies the detection threshold based on the target surroundings.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:24.600
The basis of the processes that when noise is present,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.179
the cells around the cell of interest will contain a good estimate of the noise.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.429
That is, it assumes that the noise or

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.505
interference is spatially or temporally homogeneous.

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:35.960
Theoretically, it will produce

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.270
a constant false alarm rate which is independent of the noise at clutter level.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.895
In the image, the blue wearing line is a CFAR threshold,

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:50.025
where the rest three are the fixed thresholds were different offsets.

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:53.594
CFAR allows while the targets should to be detected,

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:57.729
and at the same time, suppresses the clutter noise.

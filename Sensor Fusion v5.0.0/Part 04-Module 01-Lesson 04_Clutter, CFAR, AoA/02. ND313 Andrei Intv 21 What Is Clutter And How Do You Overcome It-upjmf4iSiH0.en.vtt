Clutter is a term used for unwanted echoes.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.269
In the context of autonomous driving, clutter might be,

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.574
for example, reflections of the road or other irrelevant stationary objects.

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:23.655
It also can be generated by rain,

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:29.230
snow, or even other radar signals.

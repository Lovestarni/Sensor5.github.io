00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.194
The 2D C4 is similar to 1D C4,

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:06.554
but it's implemented in both dimensions of the range Doppler block.

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:11.894
The 2D CSV4 implementation involves the training cells surrounding the cell in the test,

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:17.414
the guard gradient between to prevent the impact of a target signal on noise estimate.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:21.390
Different number of cells can be assigned for range and Doppler thresholding.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.740
We will learn more about the 2D C4 as we implement it in the final project.

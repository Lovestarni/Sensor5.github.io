00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
Time to try implement the 1D-CFAR in the practice workshop.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:05.780
Once you implement the code,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.580
you should be able to see the output in this format.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.664
Let's give it a try, and remember the noise samples used here are random.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:16.234
So everyone will have different plot,

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:20.989
but the important part is that we should be able to vary the threshold dynamically,

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.419
and successfully detect the target signals.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.710
Once you have the plot,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.960
you can closely observe how the Red Sea for our threshold varies along the signal length.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.314
It aligns well with the target peaks and suppresses the homogeneously spread noise.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:39.199
There will be cases where you will see false positives in your results.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.325
In that case, go back to your code,

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:43.350
and try different CNFAR set,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.820
or different number of training and guard cell numbers.

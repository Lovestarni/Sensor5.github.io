00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Welcome to lesson four.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:06.285
So far we have learned the basic principles of radar operation,

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.419
then we've worked on determining the range and upper information

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.539
about the targets by implementing the FFT techniques.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.554
In this lesson, we will discuss clutter noise,

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.509
and look into how it leads to detection failures,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.810
we will learn about the implementation of CFAR technique,

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.699
to dynamically filter the noise,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.149
and decrease the rate of false alarms, and at the end,

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.429
we will look into how radar determines the angle of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.519
arrival for different targets. So let's begin.

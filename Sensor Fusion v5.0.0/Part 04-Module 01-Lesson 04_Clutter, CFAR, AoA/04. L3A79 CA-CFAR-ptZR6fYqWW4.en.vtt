00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
CA, a sell averaging C4,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.835
is the most commonly used C4 detection technique.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:07.544
As seen in the previous lesson,

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:09.900
the 50 blocks are generated on implementing

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.509
range and Doppler FFTs across a number of charts.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.105
A C4 per sales includes,

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.554
a sliding of a window across the cells in these FFT block.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:20.789
The process looks across the cells,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.600
and decides the presence of targets based on the noise estimate.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.980
The sliding window consist of the following cells: First,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.690
is the cell under test.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.469
This is the cell that is tested to detect the presence of the target,

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.164
by comparing the signal level against the noise estimate, that is the threshold.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.909
Next are the training cells.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.929
The level of noise is measured over training cells.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.299
They can be divided into two regions,

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.069
the cells lagging the cell under test called lagging training cells,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.380
and the cells leading the training cells called leading training cells.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.289
As you see in the equation,

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.914
noise is estimated by averaging the noise level within the training cells.

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:07.450
In some cases, either leading or lagging cell average is taken.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.820
In others, the leading and lagging cell average is combined,

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.944
and higher average is taken as a noise level.

00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:18.664
The number of training cells should be decided based on the environment.

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:20.645
In a dense traffic scenario,

00:01:20.644 --> 00:01:23.089
fewer training cells should be used as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.445
closely spaced targets can impact the noise estimate.

00:01:26.444 --> 00:01:28.669
Last, the guard cells.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.765
The cells just next to the cell in the test are assigned as guard cells.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:34.700
The purpose of the guard cells is to avoid

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.790
the target signal from leaking into the training cells,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.115
which can adversely affect the noise estimate.

00:01:40.114 --> 00:01:42.559
The number of guards cells should be decided based on

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.829
the leakage of the target signal out of the cell and the test.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.620
If the cell target size is large,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.960
they often get into surrounding bins.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Now, welcome to the Midterm Project.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.060
In the previous lessons, you have learned

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.265
a great deal about key points, about descriptors,

00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:06.779
and about matching, and now,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.464
is the time to test your knowledge and apply it in practice.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.009
Now, the idea of a camera course is to build a collision detection system.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.344
That's the overall goal for the final project.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:16.740
As a preparation for this,

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.079
you will now build the feature tracking part and test

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.904
various detected descriptor combinations to see which one performs best.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.560
Now, the mid-term project consists of four parts.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.854
First, you will focus on loading images,

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.100
setting up data structures,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.295
and putting everything into a ring buffer to optimize the memory load.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:34.109
Then secondly, you will integrate

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.310
several key point detectors such as Harris, fast, BRISK,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.980
and also SIFT and compare them to each other with

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.864
regard to the number of key points and with regard to speed.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:46.484
Then thirdly, in the next part you will focus on descriptor, extraction,

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:48.549
and matching using Brute-Force and

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.339
also the FLANN approach we discussed in the previous lesson.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.225
The last part, once the coding framework is complete,

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:56.840
you will test the various algorithms, the different combinations,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.750
and compare them with regard to some performance measures.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.600
Once you have finished, the key point meshing part will be set up

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.435
for the final project and we can proceed to the next lesson.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:08.990
This one will be about integrating lighter points into camera images

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:12.530
and also on object detection in camera images using deep learning.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.060
But for now, I wish you all the best for

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.090
the project which will be quite challenging for sure.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.210
But also fun when everything clicks into place and the first results start showing up.

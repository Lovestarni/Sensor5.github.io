00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
So I'd like to take my students onto a little journey to Stanford and show them

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.734
our self-driving car that uses sensors to sense the environment.

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:14.934
So let me dive into the class very much right now.

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:19.880
So here you can see the Google self-driving car using a road map,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:22.559
localizing itself, but in

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.109
addition what's shown here in red are measurements of other vehicles.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.869
The car uses lasers and radars to track other vehicles.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.505
And today, we're going to talk about how to find other cars.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.170
The reason why we'd like to find

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.100
other cars is because you wouldn't want to run into them.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.880
So we have to understand how to interpret

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.825
sensor data to make assessments not just where these other cars are,

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:47.595
as in the localization case,

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:51.125
but also how fast they're moving.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:55.005
So if you can drive in a way that avoids collisions with them in the future,

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:59.910
it's important not just for cars and for pedestrians and for bicyclists,

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.709
and understanding where the cars are and making predictions where they're going to

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:10.304
move is absolutely essential for safe driving in the Google car project.

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:13.075
So in this class we will talk about tracking,

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:16.600
and the technique I like to teach you is called a Kalman Filter.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:21.640
This is an insanely popular technique for estimating the state of a system.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.670
Kalman Filters estimate a continuous state.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.019
And as a result,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.109
the Kalman Filter happens to give us a uni-modal distribution,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.545
and I'll tell you in a second what that means.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:34.430
Let me start with an example.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.280
Consider the car down here.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.515
Let's assume it senses this measurement: an object here,

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:47.965
here, here, and here at the times t equals 0,

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:50.215
t equals 1, 2 and 3.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:54.420
Where would you assume the object would be at t equals four?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.000
Check one of those three boxes.

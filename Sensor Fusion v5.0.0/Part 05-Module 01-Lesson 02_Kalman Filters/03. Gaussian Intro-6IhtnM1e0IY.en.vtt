00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
In common features the distribution is given by what's called a Gaussian.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.250
Gaussian is a continuous function over the space of

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.285
locations in the area underneath sums up to one.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:17.280
So use our Gaussian again and if we call

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.310
the space X then the Gaussian is characterized by two parameters.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.604
The mean, often abbreviated with the Greek letter Mu,

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:29.865
and the width of the Gaussian,

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.754
often called the variance.

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:33.920
And for reasons that I don't want to go into,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.980
it's often written as a quadratic variable,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.469
Sigma square so any Gaussian is 1-D,

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.784
which means the parameter space of a year is one dimensional,

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:48.569
is characterized by Mu and Sigma squared.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.259
Our task in common spaces is to maintain a Mu and a Sigma squared

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:58.704
as our best estimate of the location of the option we are trying to find.

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:04.609
The exact formula is an exponential of a quadratic function.

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:09.269
If we take the exponent of this complicated expression over here,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:14.310
the quadratic difference of our query point X relative to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.144
the mean Mu divided by Sigma square by [inaudible] minus a half.

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:29.780
Now if X equals Mu then the enumerator becomes 0 and we have exp of zero which is one.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.549
It turns out we have to normalize this by a constant,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.774
one over the squared root of two Pi Sigma squared.

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:41.675
But for every thing we talked about today this constant won't matter so ignore it.

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:46.140
What matters is we have an exponential of a quadratic function over here.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.974
So let me draw you a couple of functions and you tell me

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:57.114
which one you believe are Gaussian by checking the box on the right side.

00:01:57.114 --> 00:02:00.299
And please excuse my poor drawing skills here.

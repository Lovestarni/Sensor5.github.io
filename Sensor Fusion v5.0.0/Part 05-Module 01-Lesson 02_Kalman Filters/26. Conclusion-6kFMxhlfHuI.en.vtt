00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So this completes my unit on Kalman filters. You learned actually quite a bit.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You learned about Gaussians, how to do measurement updates using multiplication,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
how to do prediction or state transitions using convolution,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and you even implemented your first Kalman filter, which is really super cool.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You've implemented it in the context of vehicle tracking,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and you used this to estimate a nonobservable velocity for measurement data.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, next is your homework assignment.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I hope you can prove what you've learned and ace it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then, next week, we're going to move into particle filters, which is an exciting third method for state estimation.

00:00:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So I'll see you for the homework assignment, and then I'll see you in class for particle filters.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome to my second class on common filters.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.005
I want to take you on a little tour to where it all began, Stanford University.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.790
Behind me is VAIL, Stanford's Automotive Resource Center,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.050
and let's go inside.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.035
So, this is junior,

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.250
a Stanford's most recent self-driving car,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.620
is the child of Stanley whom you can

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.175
find in the National Museum of American History in Washington DC.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:25.200
Let me tell you something about the equipment that is

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.175
on this car that makes it self-driving.

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:29.100
So, this rotating thing over here is

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.530
a laser range finder that takes distance scans 10 times a

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.310
second about a million data points will be really important

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.550
for the common filter class I'm teaching you today.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.810
Its major function is to spot other cars so you don't run into them.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.885
This is the data that comes from the laser.

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:45.950
You can see the car parked in the garage right now,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.210
you see the back wall.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.900
These are all range measurements that tell you how far things are away,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.910
and they're essential as the input to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.350
the common filter that you're going to learn about today.

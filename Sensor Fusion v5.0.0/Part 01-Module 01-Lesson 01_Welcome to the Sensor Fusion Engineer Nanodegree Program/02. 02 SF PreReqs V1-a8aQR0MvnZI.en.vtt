00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
The prerequisites for this nanodegree program are C++,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.605
linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:11.175
For C++, we expect that you're able to write

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:16.515
C++ programs using object-oriented programming techniques and memory management.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.670
For linear algebra, we anticipate that you are prepared to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.125
multiply matrices and perform other basic matrix operations.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.430
For calculus, if you know how to take the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.445
integral and derivative of polynomial functions,

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:36.035
then you know what you need to know in order to succeed in this nanodegree program.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:42.755
For statistics, we anticipate that you are familiar with concepts like mean,

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:45.775
median, and standard deviation.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:48.065
As far as preparation,

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:52.294
if you feel like you are not ready on one or more of these dimensions,

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:56.795
then we recommend either the Intro to self-driving cars nanodegree program

00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:59.825
or the C++ developer nanodegree program.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:05.300
The intro to self-driving cars program will prepare you with the basics of C++,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.790
linear algebra, calculus, and statistics,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.480
as well as Python in machine learning that you'll need to be

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.250
successful in many of the different programs that Udacity offers, including this one.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.120
The C++ developer nanodegree program will take you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.690
deep into the development tools and techniques provided by

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.440
the C++ programming language that will bring you more than up to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.880
speed for the level of C++ that you'll need in order to be successful in this program.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
Welcome to the Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree program.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:10.094
Computers use sensors in order to perceive the world around them, and in particular,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.380
robots use many different types of sensors in order

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.995
to understand and build a model of their environment.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.400
Perception, as this task is called,

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.774
allows the robot to navigate through the environment and

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:27.614
update its understanding of its surroundings as it goes.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:30.989
Different sensors and different sensor modalities,

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.494
as they're called, have different strengths and weaknesses,

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:35.709
which you'll learn about in this program.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.439
Some sensors like cameras are passive sensors that

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:44.019
accept sunlight or other information from the world and try to interpret it.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.070
Other sensors like radar are active sensors that send data

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.350
out into the world and then receive that data

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.594
back in order to build a model of the environment.

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:57.664
Other sensors have their own strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:59.840
Some sensors have a very far range,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.439
and some sensors can only see the immediate surroundings.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.954
Some sensors can see in 360 degrees or more up and down.

00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:11.230
Some sensors can only see a straight line out and back.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.450
Fusing together all of this data from all of these different sensors enables a robot or

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.659
a computer to understand the world more fully

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.379
and build a complete picture of the environment in which it's operating.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:28.009
This technique called sensor fusion is critical to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.700
the success of any robot that operates in the world,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.240
and is an important component of building autonomous systems.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:39.179
You're going to learn how to do just that in this program.

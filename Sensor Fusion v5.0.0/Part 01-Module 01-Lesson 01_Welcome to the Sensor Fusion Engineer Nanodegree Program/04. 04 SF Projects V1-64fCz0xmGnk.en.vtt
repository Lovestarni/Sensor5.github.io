00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Each course in this Nanodegree program concludes in a project.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.200
At the end of the Lidar course,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.425
you'll build the Obstacle Detection project in which

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:13.845
you'll detect objects from 3D lidar point clouds.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.470
This is real point cloud data that you'll be

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.025
segmenting and clustering in order to detect objects.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.230
In particular, you'll apply

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.110
the k-d trees machine learning algorithm to

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.015
group points together in order to draw bounding boxes around objects.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:32.925
At the conclusion of the camera course,

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:36.795
you'll build the track and object in 3D space project.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:42.240
In this project, you'll fuse together data from both cameras and lidars.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.255
First, you'll apply neural networks to camera images.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:52.210
Then you'll identify where objects are in the same environment using lidar point clouds.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.770
Then you'll fuse this data together using back projection to project

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.705
the data from 3D lidar point clouds into the two-dimensional space of a camera image.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.935
At the conclusion of the common filter course,

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:09.250
you'll build the Unscented Kalman Filter Highway project.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.040
In this project, you'll fuse together data from

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.340
radar and lidar units in order to track vehicles on a highway.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.400
In particular, you'll build

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.710
an Unscented Kalman Filter in order to track vehicles engaged in nonlinear motion,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.790
so for example, vehicles that might be

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.460
changing lanes back and forth as they drive down the highway.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
This nanodegree program consists of four courses,

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:08.910
lidar, camera, radar, and Kalman filters.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.920
In the lidar project,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.470
you'll learn how to work with point clouds,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.355
which is the data representation that lidar units provide.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.640
You'll learn how to segment point Clouds and how to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.825
cluster points within a point Cloud in order to detect objects.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.790
In the camera course,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.315
you'll learn how to detect objects using camera images.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:33.900
You'll also learn how to fuse that data together with

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.750
a lidar point Cloud data by projecting lidar point Cloud data into the camera image.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.945
In the radar course,

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:46.090
you'll learn about both the physics in design of radar systems.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.800
In particular, you'll learn about frequency

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.070
modulated continuous wave radar systems and how

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.855
to apply signal processing like fast fourier transforms,

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:59.405
to the data that comes back from these systems.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:02.570
You'll learn about the doppler effect and how that allows

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.010
us to infer velocity from radar data,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.965
and about CFAR, constant false alarm rate and clustering,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:14.905
which are two different techniques that help us to identify objects from radar data.

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:17.165
In the Kalman filters course,

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:22.000
you'll learn how to fuse together data from a wide variety of sensor modalities,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.040
Kalman filters are a probabilistic tracking tool that utilize a measurement update cycle,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.740
in which we first take measurements and then

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.270
update our beliefs about the world using those measurements,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.600
and then we repeat that cycle,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.705
measurement update, measurement update.

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:41.520
You'll also learn how to extend Kalman filters into

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.400
extended Kalman filters and how to build unscented Kalman filters.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.580
Both of these two tools are extensions of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.690
a vanilla Kalman filter that help account for nonlinear motion data.

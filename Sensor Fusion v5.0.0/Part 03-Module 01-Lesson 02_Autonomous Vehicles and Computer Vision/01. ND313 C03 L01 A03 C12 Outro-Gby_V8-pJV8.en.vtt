00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Now in this section, you have learned a few facts about the levels of

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.564
automated driving and about the major differences between them.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.880
Currently, many experts believe that level three systems will only be

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.765
a transition step to more advanced systems which are operating on levels 4 and 5.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:15.825
At those high levels, the vehicle is capable of performing

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:19.890
all driving tasks and the driver is not required to take any control.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.539
Obviously, such systems will require

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.464
a strong engineering effort to guarantee safety at all times.

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:26.399
I suggest you try researching some of

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.759
those very cool projects which are in development right now all over the world.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.234
Take a look at Waymo and they're fully autonomous vehicle,

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:33.869
take a look at [inaudible] in England,

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:35.323
and also there is nuTonomy,

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:39.795
who in 2018 launched a public trial of self-driving cars services right in Singapore.

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.484
Now, in the next section,

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:45.034
we will take a closer look at some partially autonomous vehicles and their sensor suites.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:46.909
But for now, you should try to test

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.729
your new knowledge by answering a few quiz questions down below.

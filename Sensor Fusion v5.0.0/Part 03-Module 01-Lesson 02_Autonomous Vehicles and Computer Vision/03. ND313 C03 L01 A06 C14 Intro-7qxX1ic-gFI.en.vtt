00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
So welcome to this section which is about giving you

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.919
a short intro into cameras and Attribute Geometry.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.640
On the following, you will learn about the pinhole camera which helps you understand

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.990
how light from an object forms an image and it's transformed into pixels.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.440
You will learn some basic facts about lenses and about the aperture,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.910
about image distortion, and about differences between CCD and CMOS images.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.309
This knowledge will be useful later in the course when you need

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.709
to know how an image has been formed by the camera,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.469
so that you can compute some properties of objects in the scene,

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.259
such as, for example, time to collision to another vehicle.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.850
So let's move on and see you soon.

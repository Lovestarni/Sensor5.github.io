00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
Hi and welcome to this section of Autonomous Vehicle Sensor Sets.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.269
Now, the goal here is to give you a brief overview of the sensor sets of

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.254
some of the autonomous vehicles you might currently see on public roads.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:11.820
It's really important for you to have this overview of

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.400
the variety of sensor types among those vehicles.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.565
What you will find is that they have a varying degree of redundancy,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.950
overlapping fields of view, and in some cases,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.379
fundamentally different approaches to sensor packaging.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.064
That's how the sensor is integrated into the vehicle.

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:29.190
Also, it should take special note of similarities between those vehicles and think about

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.380
reasons why the Tesla approach to autonomy might

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.869
be different from Uber's concept, for example.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:38.140
Now, let's dive into autonomous vehicle sensors and have fun exploring.

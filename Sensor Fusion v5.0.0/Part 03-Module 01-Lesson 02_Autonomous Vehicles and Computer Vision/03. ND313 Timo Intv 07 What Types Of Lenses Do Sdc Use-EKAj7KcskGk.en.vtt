00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.120
There are different types of lenses that can be used.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.625
Wide-angle lenses, narrow angle lenses for the near field or the far fields,

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.140
that's the biggest difference.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.730
But it's also important to have a lot of intense light sensitivity,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.980
so you have a high aperture,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.839
large aperture, to get as much light in as possible.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.480
There are different types of chips.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.560
So the regular smartphone chip that you might have in your phone and it has

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.844
a typical RGB bio pattern and it has maybe a resolution of 16 megapixels or so.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:46.100
The resolution is actually not that important for self-driving cars,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.320
it's really about the sensitivity.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.820
So you see chips ranging from one megapixel to eight megapixel in terms of resolution,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.560
and then there are also pixels that do not have

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.410
this regular RGB bio pattern but a clear pixel,

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.949
every fourth pixel basically has no color filter,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.370
and then you can have better light sensitivity because of that too.

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:15.024
So there are several factors that make a camera automotive great.

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:18.760
One is basically the packaging,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.280
the ruggedness, the durability of the entire setup,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.480
meaning the integration of the chip and the lens,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.270
so that it doesn't decalibrate quickly with the varying temperatures that you

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:33.899
have in different conditions, that's one factor.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:39.649
Right now automotive grade cameras

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.820
have resolutions from one megapixel up to eight megapixel,

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.854
so it's not that crazy compared to your standard smartphone camera.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:51.739
Most likely, it will be lower resolution than that because

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:57.109
the pixels are larger and that means more photons fall into one pixel,

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.659
you have better low-light visibility so resolution is not that important,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.049
it's more the sensitivity that is important.

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:06.070
I think stereo cameras are definitely useful,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.089
but it really depends on

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.869
the overall sensor configuration or the other sensors that you have on the car.

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.929
If you consider depth estimation from the stereo camera,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.120
the density of the depth map compared to

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.770
any other sensor is really high and the precision is also great in the near field.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.754
It's just a problem in the far field and in terms of cost,

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:28.195
if you want to have a cheap,

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.594
high resolution depth sensor,

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:33.445
stereo camera in particular is the way to go.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:37.590
If you compare stereo to structure from motion with a single camera,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.900
you can basically choose,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.140
if you have a single camera,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.939
you can either reconstruct the 3D environment based on

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.625
your own motion or you can use

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:49.759
features in the static environment to estimate your own motion.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:51.664
So that's the visual odometry part.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:56.118
But as soon as you have dynamic objects in the scene and you're also moving yourself,

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.340
then you cannot really estimate the distance and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.950
velocity of other traffic participants anymore.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.790
That you can only do with stereo and I think that's why it's still very valuable.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
But it really depends on how many other sensors you also have on a vehicle.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.955
If you have a LiDAR and a RADAR who can

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:15.200
measure distance much more precisely and measure velocity much more precisely,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.185
I think the benefit for stereo is decreasing.

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.799
It's still redundancy though.

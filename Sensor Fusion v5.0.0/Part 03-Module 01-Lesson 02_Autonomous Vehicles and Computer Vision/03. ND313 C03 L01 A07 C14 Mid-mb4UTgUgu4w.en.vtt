00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Well, let me give you one final remark on camera calibration.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.160
In many applications, it makes perfect sense to use

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.290
the original image instead of the rectified one.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.570
This avoids interpolation errors which you would get when

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.635
a rectified pixel position is off-center and overlaps with its neighbors.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:16.949
In such a case, it is better to locate the feature in the original image and then

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.119
transform the resulting coordinates using the equations you just saw.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.880
When you are using deep learning instead,

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.750
it makes much more sense to rectify the image first before feeding it to the network.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.010
By using the original image,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.230
you would probably cause detection problems as

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.215
networks are usually trained on distortion free image sense.

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:34.340
If this were not the case,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.620
you would have to retrain your knowledge base every

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.079
time you change your camera and that would not be feasible.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.570
Now before we take the first steps into computer vision,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.200
you need to learn a few facts about color images and about different image or types.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.515
So go ahead and complete the section including the quiz at the end.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:54.390
In the next section, we will then start with an Intro to OpenCV and image processing.

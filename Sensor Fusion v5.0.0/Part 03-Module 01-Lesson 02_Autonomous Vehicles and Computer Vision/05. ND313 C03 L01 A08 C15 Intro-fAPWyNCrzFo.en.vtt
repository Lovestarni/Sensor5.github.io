00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Hi and welcome to this first section about computer vision.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:06.269
Now the idea here is to give you a short intro to the basics of the Open CV,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.879
which is a free and very powerful computer vision library

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.070
that even includes a deep learning framework.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.750
Now in this section, you will learn about

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.359
the matrix data type which can be used to represent images,

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.570
and also you will learn how to read and right pixels in a matrix,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.295
and how to read an image from a file.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.429
Lastly, you will learn how to store pointers to multiple images.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.545
This is particularly useful for looping over

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.995
long image sequences where memory has to be carefully managed.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.445
Now the idea here is to introduce you to some basic Open CV tools,

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.500
you will need to master the subsequent chapters

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.795
and to already give you some practice with using them.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.250
So let's get our hands dirty with

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.490
the first coding examples with C Plus Plus and the Open CV.

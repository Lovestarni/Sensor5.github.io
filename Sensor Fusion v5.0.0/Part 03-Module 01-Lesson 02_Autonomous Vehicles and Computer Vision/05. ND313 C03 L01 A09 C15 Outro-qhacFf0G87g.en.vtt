00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.254
Wow, you made it through the first coding exercises. That's great.

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.639
In this section you have used the matrix structure,

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:06.779
put images from file,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.160
changed pixels in an image,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.560
and you have learned how to store images in a dynamic list.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.540
All this knowledge will come in very handy in

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.984
later lessons when we go knee-deep into computer vision,

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.144
and also into a light up Point Cloud Processing.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:20.699
So let's move on to the next lesson now which is about understanding and designing

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.079
a collision detection system based on camera and on LiDAR sensors. See you soon.

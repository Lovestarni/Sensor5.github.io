00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Now, was it surprising to you that Tesla's not using Lidar

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.004
despite its plans to offer level four and even level five autonomous driving really soon.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.300
Well unlike Uber or Waymo and several others,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.970
Tesla has really convinced that the set of cameras coupled with

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.585
radar and ultrasonic sensors will be sufficient for full autonomy.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:17.220
At the time of recording this video,

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:18.869
there is a really fierce debate going on

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.095
about the best sensor set of autonomous vehicles.

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:23.059
Tesla always argues that the price and

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.219
the packaging issues are the ones which make Lidar really unattractive to customers.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.059
Some critics disagree, and they say that

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.369
the safety requirement movements of autonomous vehicles,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.545
they cannot be met with cameras and radar alone.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:36.395
In my opinion, as with many tech competitions before,

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:37.910
be it mono camera verses stereo,

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.059
or in the 1980's,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.929
VHS verses Betamax, price customer value and

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.229
eventually success on the major markets around the world would decide.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.284
Interestingly, despite the debate on whether

00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:49.984
radar or lidar or a combination of the two would be best,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:51.905
cameras are never in question.

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:55.219
It's there for a really good idea to learn about cameras and computer vision,

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.140
which we will do in great detail in this course.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.030
Now let's continue to look at some of the criteria

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.980
for selecting autonomous vehicle sensors.

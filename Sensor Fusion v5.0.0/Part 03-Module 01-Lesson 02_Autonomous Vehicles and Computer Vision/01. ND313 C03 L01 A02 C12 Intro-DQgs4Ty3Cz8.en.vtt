00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Hi and welcome to this first lesson.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:04.394
Now let me give you a brief intro into what's ahead of you.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.319
This section is about giving you an overview of the different definitions

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.109
of autonomy because not all autonomous cars are made equal.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.699
I want you to properly understand what it means when people talk about level two car,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.710
level four or even level five car.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
So some years ago, the Society of Automotive Engineers

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.559
has come up with a definition of those automation levels.

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:24.660
The SAE levels range from zero,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.495
which is no automation at all up to level five,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:28.920
which means full automation.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.800
Level five basically means that the vehicle is capable of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.130
performing all driving functions under all conditions.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.400
Now take a look further down in this section phone overview of level zero to level five.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.204
The important thing for you to know is that requirements with regard to performance

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:47.049
and redundancy increase exponentially once you leave level two behind.

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:50.195
Level two basically is what the Tesla autopilot currently is.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.875
Despite the school name which suggests

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:57.679
a full level five autonomy and is commonly accepted that without combining sensor data,

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.089
and this means sensor fusion,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.520
autonomous driving simply is not possible.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.650
That means by learning about sensor fusion and by putting in

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.989
the work to complete those exercises and projects,

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:07.879
you are increasing your chances of landing

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:10.594
a top job in a row and in a super exciting industry.

00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:13.650
So let's move on and dive right into it.

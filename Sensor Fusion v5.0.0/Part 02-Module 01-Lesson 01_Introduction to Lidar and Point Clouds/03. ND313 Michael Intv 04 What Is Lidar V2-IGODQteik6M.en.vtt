00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.339
Lidar is a sensor.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.250
Lidar stands for light detection and ranging.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.425
Like analog to radar.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.190
It sends out beams of light,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.150
and it measures how long it takes for the beam of light to come back.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.149
So it determines the distance to an object.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:30.149
A lidar contains a laser.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.274
A lidar is just a contraption basically consisting of a laser,

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:43.019
a method of deflection basically scanning that laser beam across the field of view,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
and photo diode or a photo detector that

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.640
detects the incoming photons that are reflected from the object.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.829
So the laser sends out a very short pulse, few nanoseconds,

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.439
and then measures the time it takes for the pulse to go to the object,

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.719
and back to the lidar where it's detected.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.435
This time gives us then an indication,

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:22.510
or gives us the exact distance to that object.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.155
You scan this laser beams across the field of view,

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:31.250
which means you get for each point in the field of view,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.265
a distance to an object or no distance if there is no object there whatsoever.

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:41.810
From this, it tells you exactly what objects there are,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.370
and how far away they are.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.769
We use lidar as one sensor in our overall sensor suite.

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:55.729
We have several different kinds of sensors.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.820
We have lidar, we have radar,

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.299
and we have various cameras, and ultrasound.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.814
All of those sensors work together to detect,

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:09.819
and track objects in the environment.

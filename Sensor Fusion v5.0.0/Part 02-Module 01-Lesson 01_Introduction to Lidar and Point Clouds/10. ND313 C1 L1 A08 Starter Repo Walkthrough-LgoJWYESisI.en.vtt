00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
Let's go ahead now and in the classroom,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.224
we have this, our workspace environment.

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:10.814
What's nice is, we can go ahead and we have this desktop button here.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:17.234
We can go ahead and launch right into this virtual desktop environment,

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:20.219
and here we have a Visual Studio code.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.844
So this is an id that's provided.

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:28.964
We can open it up. Let's go ahead and check out what the workspace looks like here.

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:34.284
So there is this directory called source,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.259
and inside source, we're going to have

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:40.214
the environment.cpp file that we're just talking about.

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:45.680
Let's go ahead and just look at this file from high overview and see what it's doing.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.799
Well, this file is going to be your main file

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.059
that it's going to have your main function here,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.460
and basically what that's going to be doing is launching

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.789
this visual window that you can use

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.834
to view your point clouds and other objects in your scene.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.689
So what other objects are those?

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.340
Well, here we're creating this simple highway environment.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.365
So there is this highway,

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.709
and that's going to be generating these virtual cars,

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:20.919
this virtual street, and it's going to be rendering this all to the viewer.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.159
Then there's also this function for doing initCamera,

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.829
and this initCamera is going to be setting up.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.629
So when you first launch the window,

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:33.019
you would have these different camera views that you can look at.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:40.144
So this kind of main function that you'll be launching in this environment.cpp.

00:01:40.144 --> 00:01:42.140
Here's another big file.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.644
This is the processPointClouds.cpp,

00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:48.890
and this one is where it has

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.769
all these function decoration setup for doing filtering, for doing segmentation.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:56.905
So if we look at this,

00:01:56.905 --> 00:01:59.430
if we go up to the top here,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.695
we can see that it's being defined as this class,

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:10.354
and it's using some different templates that we'll be talking about a little bit later.

00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:13.549
So we can actually create a point cloud processor,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.410
and then we have these functions here for doing filtering the Cloud.

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:26.639
I'm looking at doing the segmentation.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.925
So we kind of scroll down here.

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:32.610
We have a clustering function.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.920
Then we're talking a little bit about render,

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.764
and that's what's actually going to allow us to render our simulated environment.

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:42.599
Then the last thing,

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.044
we'll be working with this file pretty soon.

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:48.579
Is a lidar object which will actually be doing ray casting,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.410
and we'll use it to create some point cloud data.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
All right. So now we're actually able to launch this

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.379
executable and see what the simulated environment looks like,

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.429
let's talk a little bit more about how it's creating the scene.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.209
For doing this, there's something called the PCL viewer.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.070
So this is the point Cloud library viewer.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.649
This is what's handling graphics and rendering.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.199
So it's rendering the different boxes for the cars, for the road,

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.554
it's creating those lines and we're also using those functions in

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:36.524
environment.cpp for initializing the camera and initializing this highway environment.

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:43.329
So let's go ahead and look at what this looks like in environment.cpp.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:52.350
Inside main here, we actually have this viewer that we are creating over here.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.795
So this viewer is a PCL visualization,

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:01.725
PCL Visualizer and basically,

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:07.250
it's going to run at certain frame rate and we can add things to this viewer.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.909
So if we look at emit camera in simple highway,

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.210
we're actually passing in the viewer to these functions.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.564
Let's see how they're being passed in.

00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:19.614
So for example, in a camera,

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:27.484
we see that this PCL visualization viewer is actually being passed in as a reference.

00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:35.539
So what that means is any changes done to it will persist outside this function.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.359
So here we set things like the background color,

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.284
we can initialize the camera parameters,

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:45.545
and we can actually tell the viewer set this camera position

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:50.159
so that initial position will be set when we launch that window.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:58.549
So similarly, the init highway function is also using that viewer,

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.155
and it's being passed in as reference again right here.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:09.199
What that is doing basically is we're going through and recreating these different cars,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.519
and we're specifying where they're located in the simulation environment.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.555
We're creating a vector of those cars and for that viewer,

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:24.530
we basically call so car render in that viewer is being passed in again as a reference,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.939
and that tells the viewer, hey,

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.085
I'm going to render this car to the scene.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:32.195
I'm going to render this highway to the viewer.

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:36.289
So that is a little bit how that PCL viewer is working.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:40.079
It's handling all the graphics for us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
We were talking about this X,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.154
Y, Z Cartesian coordinates.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:05.610
So what does that actually look like?

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.960
What is this coordinate system?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.414
What's it in reference to?

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:13.349
Well, this coordinate system is actually the same as the car's local coordinates.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.765
So here, we have this top-down view.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:20.355
The X axis is defined pointing out towards the front of the car,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.964
while the Y axis is pointing out to the left,

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:24.375
while Z axis then,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.640
is pointing straight up vertical.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.609
Then we have the side view.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.644
We can see the X axis pointing out and the Z axis pointing vertically, and then,

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:35.390
this will really give us some nice details about how

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.035
these different vertical layers are organized.

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:42.079
So for the [inaudible] case,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.274
we have this top layer and it's had a minus 24.8 degree incline from the X axis,

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:55.114
and then it covers this 26.8 degree range,

00:00:55.115 --> 00:01:02.615
then each of these 64 layers will be evenly spread across this 26.8 degree range here.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:09.120
So that's how we define this coordinate system for our X, Y, Z points.

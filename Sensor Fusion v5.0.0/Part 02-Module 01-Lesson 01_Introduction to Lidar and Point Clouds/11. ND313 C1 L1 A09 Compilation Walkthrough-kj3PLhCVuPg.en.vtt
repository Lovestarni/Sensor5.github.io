00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.175
Let's go ahead now and see about compiling this Lidar Simulator.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.625
Back in my virtual workspace environment,

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:16.094
I have something called the terminator,

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:19.890
which is a terminal but it's called the terminator.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.890
We're going to go into home.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.394
We're going to check out workspace, and from here,

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:33.839
we'll go into this sensor fusion,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.775
and I just clone this from the GitHub repository.

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:44.164
Here, what you want to do is you want to make a new directory called Build,

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:47.314
and so you do MK directory Build.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.714
Then, I already did this actually,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.960
you can go into Build.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.734
Basically, we can see right here we have the CMakeList.text.

00:00:56.734 --> 00:01:01.625
So when I'm inside Build and I run c-make..,

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:06.099
this.. is saying look in the directory just one level above,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:10.309
and that it'll see that CMakeLists.txt when I call that,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.409
it'll create all the instructions needed,

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.549
so when I next to the final command build,

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.750
it'll create this executable for me.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.245
So if I go ahead and do make,

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:23.240
I build this target now and have

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:27.364
this environment executable and that I will later be using.

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:32.299
So now you can go ahead and try this for yourself.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.134
From the classroom workspace environment,

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:40.040
go into the desktop mode and then you can actually

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.255
go into the terminator cd home workspace,

00:01:45.254 --> 00:01:47.804
and from that root directory,

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:53.610
go ahead and run these commands and see if you can compile the environment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
So let's go ahead now and dive

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.759
into this starter code that we're going to be working with.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.785
Basically, what we have set up for this first couple of lessons,

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:15.074
is working with this simulated highway environment

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:19.739
where we're going to be doing lidar scanning and see the other cars around us.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.589
Then, look at the point cloud processing techniques

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.375
to figure out where these other cars are at.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:29.115
So the main files that we'll be working with, there's four of them;

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:33.614
its environment.cpp, its processPointClouds,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.825
and there's a.cpp and a header file for that as well.

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:40.140
Then, there's this render directory.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.200
You won't be working with that too closely,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.775
but it's nice to know that it's there,

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:49.140
and it has this render.cpp and render.h files.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.515
Also, is this sensors lidar.h,

00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:56.369
and we'll be using that later to do some scanning.

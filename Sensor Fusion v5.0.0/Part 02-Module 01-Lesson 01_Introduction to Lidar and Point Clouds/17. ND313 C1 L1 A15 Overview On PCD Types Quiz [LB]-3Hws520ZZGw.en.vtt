00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Now, let's go ahead and talk about templates.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.140
This was coming in effect when we're creating that PointCloud from "Scan."

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.929
So basically, we're saying that earlier there's many different kinds of PointClouds.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.335
In our case, we are using the PCL PointXYZ.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.179
So in this template,

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.730
it's being held in these arrow brackets right here.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.914
It's like an argument saying.

00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:30.314
"Okay, we're working with a PCL PointCloud,

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:32.895
and it's of type PCL PointXYZ."

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:38.840
In the future, you could have one that is PointXYZI or PointXYZ RGB.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.500
But that's what the template is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.914
and it's great because it's going to allow us to do reusable code.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.070
So in our case,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.244
we're using this PointXYZ.

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:55.689
Later, we'll be looking at PointXYZI.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.414
One thing that take notice of,

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:05.829
is let's look at how those templates being defined back in this point process Clouds.cpp.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.138
So if we look at this this file,

00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:12.584
we can see a lot of places where we have template.

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:16.789
So template is being set up with this type name PointT.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.990
Basically, what that is saying is that PointT is variable

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:25.084
and it can hold the place of any of these different kinds of PointClouds.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.189
So let's look at an example function like,

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.024
let's look at FilterCloud for instance.

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.915
If we check that out and we have that template being setup right above it.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:38.260
Let's see where that PointT is being used.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.490
So here's that PointT being used right here in places as PCL PointCloud.

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:46.625
So now, you can work with different types of PointClouds.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:50.454
But we'll notice that we have this type name here.

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:56.525
This quiz will motivate or help us understand why we're using this type name.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:02:02.234
We're actually using this pointer type here for this cloud.

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:04.079
What does that exactly mean.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.620
Well, let's look up the definition for this.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.340
So if we go back to the classroom and we will look at

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.960
templates in different PointCloud data.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.020
We have some definitions here for template.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.900
Also, we have this documentation now help with this quiz below.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.474
What is a PCL PointCloud PointT pointer?

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:29.449
Well, it's a typedef boost shared pointer.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.319
So this quiz then is asking.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.069
What do you think a PCL PointCloud PointT pointer is?

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.194
Is it a value or a type and that documentation will help you answer this.

00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:46.894
It's a typedef boost shared pointer.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:48.380
So what do you think it is?

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.139
It's a little bit of a tricky question but then we'll

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.949
talk about it and why it's important in our case,

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:59.579
and how does it relate back to type name in process PointCloud.

Awesome. You've created a lidar sensor and you're seeing

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:06.120
and have generated high resolution point cloud data with it.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.350
The data that you have generated is sufficient to detect the surrounding cars.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.724
Next you'll look at creating a point processor object

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:17.234
to detect which parts of the cloud represent the cars in traffic.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:21.070
Check out the next lesson, Point Clouds Segmentation.

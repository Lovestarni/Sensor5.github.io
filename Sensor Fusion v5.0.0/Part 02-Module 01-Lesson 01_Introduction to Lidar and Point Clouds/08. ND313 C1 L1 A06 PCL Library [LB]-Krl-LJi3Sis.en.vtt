00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Cool. Let's go ahead now and check out PCL library.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.495
So this is a Point Cloud Library.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:10.935
It's going to really help us out when working with PCD files.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:14.625
The reason that is, is because it's an open source library

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.469
for C++ and it's very widely used in robotics community.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.199
It's going to have a lot of built-in functions that we

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.838
can check out for doing filtering, segmentation,

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:28.144
and clustering, and what's really nice

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:31.609
is it has this really cool rendering capabilities as well.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.789
So we can visually look at point clouds and we can

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.030
do this really cool rendering where the different boxes,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.895
and shapes, and lines onto our viewer,

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.060
and really play around with it visually.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.705
So PCL is great for all of this.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:53.489
That's what we'll mainly be working with in this lesson.

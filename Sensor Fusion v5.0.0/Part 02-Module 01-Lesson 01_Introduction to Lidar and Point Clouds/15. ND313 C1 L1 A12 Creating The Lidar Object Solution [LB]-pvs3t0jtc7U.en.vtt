00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
All right. Let's check out the solution now for creating this lighter object.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.740
So back in environment.cpp.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.300
In this simple highway function,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.890
we can go ahead and create our Lidar as so.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.605
So here we're instantiating on the heap.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.795
So we have this lidar pointer type,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.910
and we're using the new keyword,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.969
and then the arguments were cars,

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.914
and so cars is actually just coming from the initHighway function.

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:37.844
That's just the list of cars in our simulation environment,

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:42.549
and then we're using zero just saying that our ground plane is at zero slope.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:44.599
So it's just the horizontal plane.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.530
Now, if we go ahead and say that,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.770
we could compile and then we have this lighter object.

Hi, my name is Aaron Brown.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.470
I built some lighter obstacle detection content

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:06.705
in projects that I'm excited to share with you.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:09.929
In this course, we'll be talking about sensor fusion,

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.960
which is the process of taking data from multiple sensors and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.275
combining it to give us a better understanding of the world around us.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:19.858
For instance, lidar is higher resolution than radar,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.335
but radar can directly measure velocity.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.950
By using the advantages of both these sensors,

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.199
you can get high spatial understanding where an object is at and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.744
at the same time a good idea of how fast it is moving.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:34.009
Before doing sensor fusion though,

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:35.825
you need to understand how to process

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:40.175
raw lidar data to detect where obstacles are at inside of it.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.279
So to get started let's check out in my opinion one of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.219
the most exciting self-driving car sensors lidar.

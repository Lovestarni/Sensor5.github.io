00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:12.165
Right now, we do not use a direct representation in a simulator,

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:15.359
but we are working on lidar models.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.644
There are lidar models that you can actually get.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:22.530
You would just then represent it as

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:30.135
those individual beams in the sensor model in a simulator,

00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:34.920
and you can do ray tracing in real-time

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.700
with the lidar using GPUs.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.120
Then get a very accurate point,

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.054
get the point Cloud,

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:50.649
based on however you represent your environment,

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.280
because the environment in the simulator is also only an approximation in terms of

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.655
reflectivity and whatever the material properties of surfaces are.

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:04.730
But that can be done and we are actually working on it because it makes

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.689
the simulation much more

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.379
useful because then you don't have to make that many assumptions.

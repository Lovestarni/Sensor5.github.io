00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
I'm Michael Maile, I'm working here at MBRDNA,

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:07.769
and I'm the manager of the sensor fusion team.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.869
MBRDNA stands for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America,

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.524
and it's the research and development center for Mercedes-Benz in the USA.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:22.979
I manage the sensor fusion and localization team,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.640
and our role is to come up with

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.054
a coherent and accurate description of

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:35.600
the driving environment that the autonomous vehicle finds itself in.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.734
I mainly keep the people in my team happy.

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.890
It sounds silly, but this is the main thing,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.905
keeping the team together,

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:49.120
and keeping them motivated,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:59.530
and sort of making everybody run in the same direction is my basic function.

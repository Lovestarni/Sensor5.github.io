The tools engineers use depends obviously on the engineers.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.039
There are tools that are proprietary to

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.109
each company or organization that have been developed over time.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.725
Ours come originally from working with the stereo cameras.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:30.825
There's also a very well-known library called a point cloud library,

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:35.894
that deals with the main things are really segmentation,

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:39.165
and separation of the ground plane,

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.259
and things like that.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:43.729
Those kinds of tools where you do segmentation of the point cloud

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:51.199
to get the images out of all the objects out of the point cloud,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.950
clustering segmentation, those things.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.170
There's also an open CV,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.300
are tools to work with point clouds.

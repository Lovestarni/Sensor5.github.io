00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:11.099
You would mount a lidar on the roof for the farthest field of view,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.730
but you mount a lidar on the roof it's not going to see

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.214
anything that's happening close to the vehicle down more to the bottom.

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:27.765
So to fill out the overall field of view of the senses of the vehicles,

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.675
you mount lidars in front, in the back,

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:36.590
or on the side depending on where you have gaps in the overall sense of coverage.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.180
We have a bunch on the roof kind of for maximizing the field of view,

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.604
and we have some in the front and in the back to

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:50.219
really cover the other areas that are rooftop lidars would not see.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.704
The relationship between the vertical field of view and the granularity, I think,

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:04.939
let's take the velodyne lidar where you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:13.909
have a finite or a very discrete number of layed individual layers like 16 layers,

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.944
32 layers, 64 layers, and so on.

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:23.084
Usually, all of those lidars have the same vertical field of view,

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:26.265
expressing degrees, it's about 30 degrees.

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:29.635
If you have 30 degrees and 16 layers,

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:35.210
then you have two degrees spacing between the layers in the image.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.894
Now, two degrees in about 60 meters,

00:01:40.894 --> 00:01:45.004
you can hide a pedestrian between two layers.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:49.094
So that limits your actually your resolution,

00:01:49.094 --> 00:01:52.849
but it also limits in a sense how far you can see

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.444
because if you have no scan layer on an object,

00:01:58.444 --> 00:02:02.419
then this object is invisible to the lidar.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.125
So the more layers you have in this vertical field of view,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:10.175
the finer the granularity is,

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:13.570
the more objects you can see,

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.539
and in a sense.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:21.840
The farther you can see within the overall power range off the lidar.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.000
There are several different types,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.769
the most common one or the most well known one is the one that was pioneered by Velodyne,

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.939
and this is rotating lidar.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.295
You have a rod,

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:31.800
where you have a bunch of lasers on that rod that rotates 360 degrees continuously,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.384
sending out pulses so you get this picture of the environment,

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:43.250
360 degrees and several different layers.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:47.524
That lidar rotates at about 10 Hertz,

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.519
that's the most common one.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.030
Then there are lidars that use little micro mirrors

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.969
or larger mirrors to scan the laser beam

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.079
across the one laser beam then across the field of view.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:10.219
You have solid-state lidars that use a phased array type principle,

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.745
like phased array radars,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:18.620
where the phase differences between beams are used to steer,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.495
basically steer the beam.

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:31.150
You have lidars that use the dispersion relationship and prisms,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:40.140
and then there are other little bit more exotic electro-optic ways of doing things.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:52.500
The power that a lidar consumes is dependent on a few things.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.650
I mean the overall system,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:03.575
like the current Velodyne 32 POC uses 10 watts in total.

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:08.305
The old Velodyne, this huge

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:14.615
contraption on top of the car with the old 64 beam used about 60 watts.

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:18.995
But what's more interesting though is the output power of the laser,

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:23.370
because that depends then on the wavelengths,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.310
and this is correlated with eye safety.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.115
So, if you have a laser in the 905 nanometer range,

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:43.485
that's the shorter wavelength range that uses about two milli-watts.

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:47.730
If you go with a laser that's, let's say,

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:53.429
in the 1,500 nanometer range, that can use,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.770
I think up to 10 times more power,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.305
which means it can actually reach further than the short wavelengths laser,

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:04.275
and be as eye safe as the other one,

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:08.849
but it also has more expensive components.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.875
A lidar beam is eye safe if you can look into

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:21.659
the lidar beam without it hurting your eye, basically.

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:29.750
There are different wavelengths have different power levels where this is eye safe.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.759
There are different classes of lasers and

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:42.469
usually the class used for automotive lidars is class one,

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.789
that is eye safe.

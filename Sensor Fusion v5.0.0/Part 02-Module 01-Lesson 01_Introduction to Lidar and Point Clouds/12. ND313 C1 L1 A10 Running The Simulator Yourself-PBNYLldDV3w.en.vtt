00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
All right, cool.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.359
So we went through and compiled our executable,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.984
and now we're actually going to look at running the environment.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:14.609
This is what the output of that should look like,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.410
where here we have our ego car in green,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.670
we have these other traffic cars in blue,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.290
and it's all sitting nicely on this little virtual highway street.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.974
So for doing the instructions for running this simulation environment now.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:32.910
Once you actually compile

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:36.389
that executable is actually pretty straight forward just to run it,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.179
all you have to do is do.

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.600
/environment within that bell directory.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.728
Then, we'll be able to look around this environment,

00:00:46.728 --> 00:00:49.280
we can use the mouse to zoom around,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.105
orbit and just check out our scene.

00:00:53.104 --> 00:01:01.199
So let's go ahead and check that out inside belt if we just do environment.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.829
We now have this highway environment to look at with our green car,

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.179
and so go ahead and try this out for yourself now.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.380
Launch the environment, just go ahead and explore what that looks like.

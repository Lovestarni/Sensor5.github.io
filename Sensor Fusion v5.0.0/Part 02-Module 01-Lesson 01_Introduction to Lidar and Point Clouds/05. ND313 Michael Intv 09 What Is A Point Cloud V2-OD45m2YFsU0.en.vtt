00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.769
What is a point cloud?

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:14.625
A point cloud is the set of all the Lidar reflections that is measured.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:24.570
So each Lidar, each point is one laser beam going to the object being reflected,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.050
and that creates a point because the laser beam is relatively tight in diameter.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.054
Then you collect all of the reflections of those laser beams from the environment,

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:42.039
and this creates this point cloud.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.625
The data Lidar generates depends on the principle of the Lidar field of you,

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.795
and you know how dense the beams are.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:03.304
But let's call it a 100 megabyte per second roughly,

00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:05.239
can be the more can be less.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.429
If you have 64 lasers,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.890
obviously that thing generates way more data than if you have only two layers,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.390
or 10 or 30 layers.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.290
So it depends a little bit on the Lidar itself.

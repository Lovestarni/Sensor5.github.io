00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
All right. So this typedef boost shared pointer is actually going to be a type,

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:08.085
and why that is important here is,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.105
when the compiler is looking at templates,

00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:16.050
so would reference back here when we are in processPointClouds.cpp,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.225
when it sees as value that's going to be using a template inside,

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.570
it doesn't actually have enough information

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.339
to figure out if it's going to be a value or a type,

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.159
and so it'll actually assume that it's a value.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.369
Unless you use this type name which is specifically saying no,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.390
this is actually going to be a type.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.255
So what does that mean exactly?

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:47.515
Well, it means that if it looks at this and the compiler thinks it's a value,

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:50.914
it's actually going to have a compilation error.

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:52.460
So you could try this out,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.515
if you take this type name away,

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:58.355
because the compiler is thinking it's a value when it's really a type.

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:01.089
So by having this type name,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.315
you're actually telling the compiler, no, wait.

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:05.129
This actually really is a type,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.024
and then it'll be able to compile successfully.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:13.675
What this just means then is in the processPointClouds.cpp file,

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:19.625
any place that you have this extension of pointer on this PCL pointCloud template,

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.500
you'll want to use a type name.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.049
So kind of looking at this file,

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.734
you'll see this pattern of where you're using

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.629
these different type names whenever you have this pointer extension.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:34.439
So it will be-

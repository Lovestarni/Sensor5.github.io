00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.769
All right, let's go ahead and check out looking at this point Cloud data now.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.724
So back in environment.cpp,

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:09.914
instead of calling render rays,

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:14.639
we can call render Point Cloud which is defined in render.cpp,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.094
and we're going to be giving it our viewer and this input Cloud,

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:21.419
and we'll just call it input Cloud as well.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.820
So it wants to have a name associated with it,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.850
this way you can have multiple point Clouds showing up in

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.765
the viewer and each one can be identified.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:35.579
The other thing that we're going to do is not render

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.094
our scene because we'll just want to render the point Cloud data by itself.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:42.435
So we'll make that false.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.600
Now, if we go ahead and save our file,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.789
and then we go back into,

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.509
let me go ahead and do full screen on this.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.668
We go into the terminator and we make our latest changes,

00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:04.950
we can then run the simulator and see what the point cloud data looks like.

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:16.179
All right. Let's go ahead and launch the executable.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.239
Now you'll see that it's a little bit different

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.939
from the image that we're showing back in the previous slide

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.549
because we have a mean distance of five so we don't

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.609
see any of the points from the roof of the ego car,

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.689
and also we have noise.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.060
So and you can see it's nice little scattering effect.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.325
It looks a little bit more realistic,

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.540
not quite as like symmetric in clean.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.655
Also, we can move around and we can see

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:44.719
where the lidar is picking up these cars on the road.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.370
So there's one car over here in this cluster.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.395
There is another car over here.

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:56.329
We're not seeing as much of it as that other one because it's not as close to the lidar.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.879
So this is something where you can play with

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:03.944
the lidar hyper parameters and see if you can get higher resolution,

00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:07.574
better defined scans of your environment.

00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:12.120
Then that last car is back over here.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.460
It's right here, and so we can really

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.060
CM if we tried to get it an orbit position where we can see the flat plane,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.824
and then these things poking up above the ground.

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:29.409
That's what we'll be going into next,

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.870
is really how to separate these ground plane

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.395
points from everything else which includes our cars.

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:42.590
So, you can also look at the camera parameters too and see if you do it in a side view,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.575
you can get a nice glimpse of them there maybe.

00:02:45.574 --> 00:02:49.739
But that's what our point Cloud data looks like.

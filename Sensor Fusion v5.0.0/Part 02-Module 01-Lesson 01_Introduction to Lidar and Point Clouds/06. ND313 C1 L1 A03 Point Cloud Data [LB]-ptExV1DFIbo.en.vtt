00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Cool. So now what are we going to be doing with these points?

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.390
Now, let's talk about the point Cloud data.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.375
This is going to be the format for our points.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.439
So this is a.PCD file.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.500
Then we're looking at the previous slide and we said okay,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.484
256,000 points for every update.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:22.109
Well, each of these points is going to be represented

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.839
in this format where we have this X,

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.859
Y, Z Cartesian coordinates and we also have this I value.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.969
So before we're saying that we also have this signal strength of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.089
the laser and that tells us a little bit

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.295
about the reflective properties of this material.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:38.990
So that's going to be this I.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.635
So we have this X, Y, Z,

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:44.239
I and for a single update for the BOP 64,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.175
we have 256,000 of those.

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:51.089
This is actually what this PCD looks like.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.730
Here, we're seeing that the different intensity values are a different color.

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.549
So this color mapping here is telling us about

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.609
the reflective properties of the objects and then X,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.075
Y, Z is specially telling us where this point is located.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:09.400
Then in this running PCD video,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.359
we can see this bicyclists just

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.790
writing out in front of the car and we're chasing after him.

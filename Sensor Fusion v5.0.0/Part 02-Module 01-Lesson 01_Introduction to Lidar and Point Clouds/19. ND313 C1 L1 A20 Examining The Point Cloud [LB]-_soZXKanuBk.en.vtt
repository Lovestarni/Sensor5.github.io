00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
So let's check out examining the point cloud now.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.244
So we're able to change

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:12.030
our LiDAR hyperparameters and get a higher resolution scan of our environment.

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:18.464
Now, let's actually look at what this looks like as a PCD, point cloud data.

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:21.120
This is what we're shooting for.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.785
In this image here,

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:27.210
we went ahead and we are not rendering the highway environment anymore,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.080
but we are just rendering the point cloud data from it by itself.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.744
What we see here,

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.265
so in this particular PCD,

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.064
there wasn't any noise.

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:39.614
So you can tell it's very symmetric.

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.300
Also, the min distance was left at zero,

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.834
so we can see the roof points of our car here.

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:51.980
Now, the important thing is we're seeing these kind of clusters being dealt up.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.204
There's one over here,

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:55.439
there's a little bit over here,

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.789
and there's something over here.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.314
These are actually those three blue cars,

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:02.344
and they're showing up in our PCD data.

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:08.480
So later, we can use some processing to actually detect where those obstacles are at.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.984
So in this next exercise,

00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:15.500
we're going to be creating this point cloud data that we'll be later

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.230
using in the other lessons to do some obstacle detection with.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.385
So in this exercise,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:29.615
we're going to be visualizing what this PCD data looks like.

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:31.324
In order to do that,

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.590
instead of calling render rays,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.820
there's another function called render point cloud,

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.574
and this is also in the render.cpp file.

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:44.969
So if we look at render.cpp,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.715
there's a renderRays and there's a renderPointCloud.

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:55.984
So go ahead, and instead of doing renderRays,

00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:58.760
call the renderPointCloud and also just look at some of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.719
the arguments for renderPointCloud.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.280
So it has a viewer.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.974
Anytime we're doing any sort of rendering,

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:10.430
we'll have that viewer,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.469
we have that point cloud.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.645
So renderRays had that as well,

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:17.725
but this time we don't have that position because

00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:20.979
renderRays knew that because it needs to know how the rays,

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.369
the starting position of where the rays were being cast from.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.509
We also have some color information.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.799
Now, by default it'll just rendersPointCloud is white,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.740
but you could also fill it in with different colors if you wish.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.700
So back in environment.cpp,

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.444
change the renderRays to renderPointCloud.

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:48.680
Then, also if you just want to render the point cloud by itself

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.395
without any of the cars in the street,

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:57.159
there's a flag environment.cpp,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.120
and there's this renderScene,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.430
and you can just turn renderScene to false,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.439
and then you'll just get the renderPointCloud by itself.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:12.960
So go ahead and generate this point cloud and visualize it in your window.

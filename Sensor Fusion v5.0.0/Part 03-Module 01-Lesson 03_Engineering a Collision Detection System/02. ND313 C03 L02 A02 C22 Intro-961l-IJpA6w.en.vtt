00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
So now that we know about motion models,

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:03.809
and about the variables involved,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.800
let's take a look at how to compute the time to collision based on lidar measurements.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.949
Down below in this section, you will find the derivation of the time to collision

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.189
based on two successive distance measurements to the preceding vehicle.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.599
In order to get this distance,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.759
we will look at a way to reduce the thousands of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.490
lidar points to those located on the preceding vehicle,

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.649
maybe on the tailgate, maybe on the license plate.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.169
That means we need to remove the road surface and all those

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.570
points who are not reliable enough.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.839
Once we did this, I will introduce you to a first piece of code that will return

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.530
a TTC estimate in seconds based on two lidar point clouds.

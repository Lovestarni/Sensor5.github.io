00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Now, in this section, we have taken a look at two motion models.

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:04.740
The first one is the constant velocity model,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.115
which assumes that the velocity of the preceding vehicle does not change.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:09.285
As you can see here,

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.339
this model does not fit very well to the real world,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.960
when it is about detecting collisions.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.339
Now when a vehicle breaks,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.640
its velocity decreases over time,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.379
and is therefore not constant.

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:20.559
We have also seen the constant acceleration model,

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.059
which allows for velocity change under the assumption,

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.339
that acceleration is not constant.

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.925
Now the question is, how much do both models differ?

00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:29.875
Let's take a look at the following scenario.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.600
As you can see here in this scenario we have yellow vehicle,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.414
which is following a green vehicle,

00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:36.560
and the other one is equipped with some kind of sensor.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.700
Let say a lighter sensor,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.050
and this sensor returns 3D measurements for example those red crosses here,

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.559
that might be 3D points returned by the sensor of yellow vehicle.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.390
Now, what we do here is we look at the closest point which is measured,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.730
and this closest point gives us the distance DT which is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.359
valid for the time T. We have two models here.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.250
The first one is the constant velocity model,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.570
which is reflected by V0 and V0 is always 30 kilometers per hour.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.409
The second model we have is the constant acceleration model,

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.024
and this of course has a varying speed but at a point in time T,

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:12.609
this speed is also VT equals 30 kilometers per hour.

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:17.155
That means it's the same initial speed as V0 for the constant velocity model.

00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:20.370
Now, when the green vehicle breaks,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.570
of course it decelerates,

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.234
and the deceleration is constant,

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:24.734
and as reflected by A0,

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:28.144
and A0 is at five meters per square second.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:29.659
Now the question for you is,

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.204
what's the time to collision until the green vehicle and the yellow vehicle collide,

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:36.890
based on AV the constant velocity model,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.030
and B the constant acceleration model here?

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.269
Compute those values using the equations you have seen in the section,

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:49.864
and also compare the results and look at which model gives you which time to collision.

00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:53.420
Now please go ahead and compute the TTC and seconds for both motion models,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.570
by solving the motion equations you saw earlier.

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.889
You should see a big difference between both models.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.180
In a commercial product,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.700
we would not choose the constant velocity model.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.250
Once you complete the exercise, you will know why.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.719
But in the context of this course,

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.679
it makes sense to use constant velocity,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.650
just because we can focus more deeply on computer vision aspects,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.435
and said without making the code it involves in the math too complicated.

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:17.650
So let's do the math, and run the numbers.

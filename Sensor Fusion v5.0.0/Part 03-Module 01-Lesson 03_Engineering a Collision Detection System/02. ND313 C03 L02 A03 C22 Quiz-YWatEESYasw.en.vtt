00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
In this section, you have familiarized yourself with how lidar measurements look,

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.044
and how you can use them to compute the time to collision.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:08.519
Also, you have seen that erroneous points may

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.189
lead to a severe miscalculations when not treated properly.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.390
To make sure you are familiar with the code,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.070
please complete the quiz below.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.484
The task here is to extend the function,

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:22.429
compute TTC lidar in a way that not all points are considered.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.225
We want to focus only on the eagle lane in which our vehicle is currently located.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:31.340
So your task is to introduce a new variable called lane width and set it to four meters.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.674
Based on this variable,

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:34.949
all points left and right should be removed,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.775
and not be used for computing the distance to the preceding vehicle.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:39.533
In a real-time and a real application,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.229
you could also use the current steering angle or the curvature of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.349
the lane markings on the road to filter out unwanted points.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.984
But in our small example here,

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:48.469
it's about the basic principle,

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.969
which is why we want to keep it simple.

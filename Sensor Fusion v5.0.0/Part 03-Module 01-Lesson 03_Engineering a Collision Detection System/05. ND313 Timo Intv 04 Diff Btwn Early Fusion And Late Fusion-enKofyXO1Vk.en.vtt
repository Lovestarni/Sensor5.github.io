00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:08.664
The difference between early fusion and late fusion is that during early fusion,

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:12.730
the fusion algorithm has access to the raw data of the camera, of the light,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.144
of the radar, and processes everything together to produce one final output.

00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:23.934
In late fusion, every sensor basically tries its best by its own first.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:26.289
As we track the object and the camera,

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.269
you want to track an object in the lidar and the radar,

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.000
and then you do a track to track fusion in the very end.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.219
So basically, combining all the tracks as your final output.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.409
But there is a spectrum in between actually,

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:45.559
so there you can also fuse on levels lower than late fusion and higher than early fusion.

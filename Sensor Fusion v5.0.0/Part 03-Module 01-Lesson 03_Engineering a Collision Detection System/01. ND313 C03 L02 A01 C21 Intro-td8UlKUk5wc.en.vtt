00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Hi, it's good to have you back on

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.609
this next section on how to approach the collision detection problem.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.310
I told you in the first lesson that you will be developing a collision avoidance system,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.234
and this course and other big question is, where do we start?

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.379
Now before we dive into code and algorithms,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.300
let's take a step back and look at the problem.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.710
I have something for you here.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.140
Imagine you have a police car and a Lamborghini,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.289
and the Lamborghini is driving away and the police car is chasing it.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.960
Now this one breaks, the Lamborghini brake slows down,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.240
and obviously the police car approaches quickly.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.059
What we want is a system that is able to warn us,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:31.394
and this means the police car,

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:34.424
in time before a collision with the preceding vehicle occurs.

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:38.024
Maybe you have heard that the human reaction time is approximately one second.

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:40.339
So a good system should warn us way ahead of that,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.370
and this is why most available systems issue a warning

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.579
or trigger the break about two seconds before a collision is imminent.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.725
So we have already done the first step here.

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:53.060
We have transformed this problem of how to avoid collisions into a new problem,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.719
which is how to compute the time until the collision occurs.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.504
In order to solve this new problem,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:00.200
you need to take a look at a few things.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.535
First, familiarize yourself with the variables we need to measure.

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:04.759
Then, take a look at

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.125
the two different ocean models we could use to describe vehicle movement.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.730
Then thirdly, test your new knowledge in a quiz and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.939
self-emotion equations for the time to collision computation.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.950
Once you have done all that, you are ready to attack

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.180
the problem with some code. Let's go for it.

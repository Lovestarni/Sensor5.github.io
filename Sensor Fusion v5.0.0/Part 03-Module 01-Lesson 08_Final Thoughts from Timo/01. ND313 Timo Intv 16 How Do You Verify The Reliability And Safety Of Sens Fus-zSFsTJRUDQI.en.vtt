00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.824
So the validation and verification of

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:11.699
sensor fusion system or an autonomous vehicle as a whole is really challenging.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.719
The entire industry is still trying to figure this out.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.120
But there are certain standards that we want to apply.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.429
The straightforward thing is that, of course,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.929
we drive millions of miles,

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.609
collect data, annotate it.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.050
We go to test REX,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.509
stage specific corner cases,

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.045
basically see what the vehicle is doing,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:33.195
and adjust our algorithms to handle the case as well.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:37.890
But then also, we need to actually develop according to standards,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.539
industry standards which means there have to be processes in place.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.350
They are basically, coding rules in place and for everything that can go wrong,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.179
we have to have a safety measure and backup plan, basically.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.800
So the sensor fusion module really interacts with the rest of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.359
the robotic stack in terms of it's right at the core.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.334
So you have upstream,

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:06.099
your perception modules, and downstream,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:11.344
you're planning modules and you have to be the component that brings everything together.

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:15.965
So you need to understand a lot about perception and how perception algorithms work.

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:17.689
But you also have to understand

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.724
the downstream application of what is planning want to do with the data,

00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:24.349
how do we want to predict objects into the future.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:28.129
All of this basically, has to be brought together in the right way and

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:33.349
it really depends on before and after the upstream and downstream,

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:36.750
how you best structure your sensor fusion algorithm.

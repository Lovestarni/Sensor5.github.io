You can do this by simply checking wether the corresponding keypoints are within the region of interest in the camera image. All matches which satisfy this condition should be added to a vector. The problem you will find is that there will be outliers among your matches. To eliminate those, I recommend that you compute a robust mean of all the euclidean distances between keypoint matches and then remove those that are too far away from the mean.\n\nThe task is complete once the code performs as described and adds the keypoint correspondences to the \"kptMatches\" property of the respective bounding boxes. Also, outlier matches have been removed based on the euclidean distance between them in relation to all the matches in the bounding box.\n\n## FP.4 : Compute Camera-based TTC\n\nOnce keypoint matches have been added to the bounding boxes, the next step is to compute the TTC estimate. As with Lidar, we already looked into this in the second lesson of this course, so you please revisit the respective section and use the code sample there as a starting point for this task here. Once you have your estimate of the TTC, please return it to the main function at the end of computeTTCCamera.\n\nThe task is complete once the code is functional and returns the specified output.

Look for several examples where you have the impression that the Lidar-based TTC estimate is way off. Once you have found those, describe your observations and provide a sound argumentation why you think this happened.\n\nThe task is complete once several examples (2-3) have been identified and described in detail. The assertion that the TTC is off should be based on manually estimating the distance to the rear of the preceding vehicle from a top view perspective of the Lidar points.\n\n## FP.6 : Performance Evaluation 2\n\nThis last exercise is about running the different detector / descriptor combinations and looking at the differences in TTC estimation. Find out which methods perform best and also include several examples where camera-based TTC estimation is way off. As with Lidar, describe your observations again and also look into potential reasons. This is the last task in the final project.\n\nThe task is complete once all detector / descriptor combinations implemented in previous chapters have been compared with regard to the TTC estimate on a frame-by-frame basis. To facilitate the comparison, a spreadsheet and graph should be used to represent the different TTCs.\n\nWe are super-excited to receive your submission as soon as possible.",

This is done to ensure that you are able to test your code in an environment similar to what reviewers will use. \n\nIf you have developed your project locally, you can upload the project directory to the workspace for submission. Similarly, if you have your code in Github, you can clone your project into the workspace for submission.\n\nPlease check your submission against the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2550/view) before submitting. We look forward to your project submission!",

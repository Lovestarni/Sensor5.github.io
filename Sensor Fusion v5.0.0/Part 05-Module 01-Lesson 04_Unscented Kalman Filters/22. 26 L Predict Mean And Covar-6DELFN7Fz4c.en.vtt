00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
Awesome. You implemented a C++ function to predict the Sigma points.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.099
This means, we can move on to the next step and

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.330
calculate the mean and the covariance matrix of the predicted state.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.925
Let's look at the visualization again.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:18.089
First, we generated the Sigma points.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.160
Then, we predicted them.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.699
Now, we want to use the Sigma points to calculate

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.285
the mean and the covariance of the predicted state.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.254
The standard rule for calculating the mean and

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:34.604
covariance of a group of state samples is given by these equations.

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.474
The index i means,

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:39.969
we are talking about the column number i of this matrix.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.570
However, we have these additional weights we need to consider.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.200
Obviously, we need a weight for every Sigma point,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.080
and this is how the weights are calculated.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.969
You can see that these weights somehow depend on the spreading parameter lambda.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.935
We use lambda before to set how far we want to spread the Sigma points.

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.679
Why do we need to consider lambda again here?

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.569
Think about it like this.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:10.000
Before we had a covariance matrix and generated Sigma points,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.170
now we're doing the inverse step.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.900
We have predicted Sigma points and we want to recover the covariance matrix.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.855
So, we also have to invert the spreading of the Sigma points,

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:22.910
and this is what the weights do.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.280
There's more than one correct way to define

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.155
these weights and you will find several suggestions if you look into the literature.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:34.710
But in this lesson, we will stick with these rules. All right.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.239
That's how you calculate the mean and the covariance of your predicted Sigma points.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.199
With this, you will have completed the UKF prediction step.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.900
In the last lesson we used a process
model with constant velocity.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.100
However, with the assumption that the
velocity is constant you're simplifying

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.140
the way vehicles actually move
because most roads have turns.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.262
But this is a problem because a
process model with the assumption of

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:20.980
constant velocity and direction will
predict turning vehicles incorrectly.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.740
In the next quiz, think about
how assuming constant velocity

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.250
might effect the prediction for
a vehicle that is turning.

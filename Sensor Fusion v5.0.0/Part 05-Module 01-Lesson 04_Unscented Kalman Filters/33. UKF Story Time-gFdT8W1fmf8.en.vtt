00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Today, we're here with Sebastian,

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.298
because there's one important thing about

00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:06.275
the unscented Kalman filter we haven't explained yet.

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:12.019
Sebastian, could you tell us why the unscented Kalman filter is called unscented.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.843
Okay. So, I'm Sebastian,

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:15.179
I'm lived long time,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.640
old enough to witness these early stories.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.280
A long time ago, two grad students,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.300
which invented the unscented filter,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.019
called unscented because they felt that the extended Kalman filter stinks,

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:30.418
and they felt it stinks because they were deeply

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.484
dissatisfied by linear rising among this one operating point.

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:36.164
And further, if you sample this,

00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:40.728
then you would get a much better estimate of what the better linearization look like.

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:42.711
The fact that the adviser, turns out,

00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:45.329
was a very religious person,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.489
believing in the extent of Kalman filter,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.940
and there was a bit of a fight going on and

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.210
the students that personally practice on their own without

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
the fairy adviser called it specifically unscented to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.509
make this point loud and clear to the entire world that the old stuff,

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:02.728
the extended Kalman filter stinks.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.316
That's a nice story.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.989
Yeah. Now, we know why linearization stinks.

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:08.724
And I hate Jacobians,

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.412
let this be on record, I don't like Jacobians.

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:12.810
I think we can all agree.

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.920
Congratulations, combining LIDAR and
RADAR measurements with the help of

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.000
extended and unscented Kalman
filters is incredibly impressive.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.140
These are core skills that we use on
the Sensor Fusion team at Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.920
&gt;&gt; Let's think about where Sensor Fusion
fits into the entire autonomous vehicle

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.620
technology stack.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.311
First, sensors record the data, then
there are pre-processing steps such as

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:30.240
clustering algorithms, or more complex
solutions to detect object hypothesis.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.490
And finally, we can use these hypotheses
as input for object level fusion.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.170
&gt;&gt; Inside the sensor fusion block,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.980
we combined that data together
like you did in this lesson.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.270
And this is not the only possible flow,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.660
we can apply sensor fusion at
each of these processing steps.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.820
&gt;&gt; Once we have the more consistent
representation of the surrounding world,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.670
we pass the results to other part of
the autonomous vehicle system Further

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.250
down the line, different teams will
use this data to localize the vehicle,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.920
control the vehicle, and
plan the vehicle's path.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.300
&gt;&gt; It's also worth thinking about ways
in which the world is more complicated

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.360
that what we've discussed so far.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.060
For example, in this lesson,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.030
we have assumed there is
only one object to track.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.680
But what if there are many
cars on the street?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.210
Then you have to find out which
measurement belongs to which vehicle,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300
that makes sensor fusion even harder.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.710
&gt;&gt; But the core techniques you have
learned in this lesson are the key to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.430
extended the sensor fusion block to
handle these more complex scenarios.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.110
&gt;&gt; Sensor fusion is a critical part
of an autonomous driving system and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.910
the other parts of the system
rely on this data.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.040
&gt;&gt; In future modules, you will learn
about how the components of this system

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.690
used fused sensor data to
complete their functions.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.530
Good luck on the final
sensor fusion project.

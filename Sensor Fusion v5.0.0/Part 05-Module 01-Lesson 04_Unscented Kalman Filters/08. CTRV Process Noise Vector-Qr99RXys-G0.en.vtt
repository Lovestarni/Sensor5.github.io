00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.780
What we have introduced so far was the
deterministic part of the process model.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.020
But of course, we also need to consider
the stochastic part of the process model

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.070
and that has something to do
with the process noise nu k.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.450
We will describe the uncertainty of
the process model with a two-dimensional

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.320
noise vector nu k, consisting of two
independent scalar noise processes.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.910
The first noise process is the
longitudinal acceleration noise nu a.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.230
It influences the longitudinal
speed of the vehicle and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.970
it randomly changes its
value at every time step k.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.550
The longitudinal acceleration
is a normally distributed white

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.320
noise with zero mean and
the variance sigma a squared.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.540
The other noise process is the yaw
acceleration nu-psi-dot-dot.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.808
It is also a normally-distributed
white noise with zero mean and

00:00:56.808 --> 00:01:00.851
it has the variance sigma
psi dot dot squared.

00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:05.765
And what I want to discuss with you
next is how the noise vector nu k

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.320
influences our process model.

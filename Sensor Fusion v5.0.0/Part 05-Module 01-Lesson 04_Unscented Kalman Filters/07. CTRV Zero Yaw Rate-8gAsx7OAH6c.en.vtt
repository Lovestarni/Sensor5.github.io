00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.190
Now we have the solution
of the integral.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.822
It is a function that brings
the state from time step k,

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:10.460
to time step k + 1, awesome.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.090
There's only one problem
with our solution and

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.820
that is the division by 0
when the yaw rate is zero.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.460
And this is an important
case because it means

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.640
the vehicle is driving on a straight road,
which happens quite often.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.110
There are two ways to derive
the solution for this special case.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.110
You can put the yaw rate to 0
right from the beginning and

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.190
solve the integral again,
for this special case.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.520
But remember, when the yaw rate is 0,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.400
it means the vehicle drives
in a straight line.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.420
In this case,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.840
you can also directly see the solution
by looking at the triangle again.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.600
In the next quiz, try to identify
the correct process model for

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.032
the special case when the yaw rate is 0.

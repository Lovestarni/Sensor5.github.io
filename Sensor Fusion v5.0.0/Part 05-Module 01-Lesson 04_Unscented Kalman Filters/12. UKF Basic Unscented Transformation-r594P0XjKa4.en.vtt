00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:03.919
What we will do in the remaining part of
this lesson is go through the processing

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.413
chain of the unscented
Kalman filter step by step.

00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:09.955
We will start with an example state
vector x and covariance matrix p and

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:11.817
go all the way through prediction and

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:15.615
measurement step until we reach
the updated state and covariance matrix.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.951
For every step, you will implement
a C++ function right away.

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.946
So you will be well prepared for
the project in the end.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:25.320
As always, we will of course
start with the prediction step.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.608
As you've seen before, we can split the
unscented prediction into three parts.

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:33.152
First, we need to know a good
way to choose sigma points.

00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:36.448
Second, we need to know how
to predict the sigma points.

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:39.582
Well, that's easy, just insert
them into the process function.

00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:43.465
And third, you need to know how to
calculate the prediction, mean, and

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.958
covariance from
the predicted sigma points.

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:47.436
Let's start with the first step.

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:49.109
How do we choose the sigma points?

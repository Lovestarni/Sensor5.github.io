00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.870
Welcome to the last coding
quiz before the project.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.378
What we want to calculate this time
is the updated state x and

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:10.530
the updated covariance matrix P.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.850
We need a lot of
pre-calculated data this time.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.160
These are the predicted sigma
points in the state space.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.890
This is the predicted state mean and
the state prediction covariance.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.920
You can use this variable x again, and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.520
override it later with
the updated state.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.550
The same is true for

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.110
the variable P, override this one
with the updated covariance matrix.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.269
Here we have the predicted sigma
points in the measurement space.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.720
This is the predicted
measurement mean and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.110
this is the covariance of
the measurement prediction.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.530
And of course, you need some values for
the actual measurement z.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.225
Here you can store your
intermediate results for

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:53.985
the cross correlation matrix T.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:01:00.445
Again, make sure to use the variable
x and the variable P to store your

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:03.925
updated state and
your updated covariance matrix.

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:06.625
All right,
good luck with this final coding quiz.

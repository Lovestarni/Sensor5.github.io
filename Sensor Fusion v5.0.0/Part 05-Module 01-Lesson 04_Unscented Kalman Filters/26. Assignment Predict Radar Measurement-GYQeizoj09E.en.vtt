00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.200
The goal of this coding quiz
is to predict the mean and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.700
the covariance of a radar measurement.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.170
We expect a radar measurement, so I set
the measurement dimension to three here.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.340
This is an example how
I set the weights.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.010
To be able to build the measurement
covariance matrix R,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.900
you need the values for
the radar measurement uncertainty.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.700
And of course,
you need the predicted sigma points.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.950
This is the matrix, where you can
store your measurement sigma points.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.700
And these are the two output objects,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.030
the predicted measurement mean, and
the predicted covariance matrix S.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.930
Good luck with the quiz.

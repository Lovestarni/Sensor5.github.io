00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.980
What you have derived for
the CTRV model, is a process model that

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.500
considers the possibility to drive
on a straight line, or doing a turn.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.770
That's really great because it will
help us to achieve good results

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.400
when tracking a bike
in the project later.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.271
Now let's go to the next part of this
lesson, and see how the UKF works.

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.341
The way the unscented Kalman filter
processes measurements over time is

00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:25.210
exactly the same as the extended
Kalman filter does.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.740
We have a prediction step, which is
independent of the measurement model.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.350
In this step, you will use
the CTRV model we just delivered.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.215
Then we have an update step where we
use the radar measurement model, or

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:36.406
the laser measurement model,

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:38.584
depending on the type of
measurement we just received.

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:43.199
This means you'll be able to apply
the same top level processing chain for

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.590
the unscented Kalman filter as you
use for the extended Kalman filter.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.155
The difference between the unscented and
the extended Kalman filters is how

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:55.496
the unscented Kalman filter deals
with the non linear process models or

00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:56.572
measurement models.

00:00:56.572 --> 00:01:00.269
For that, the unscented Kalman filter
uses an approach called unscented

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.238
transformation.

00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:02.680
Let me show what this is.

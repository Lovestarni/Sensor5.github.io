00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.380
In this quiz, we have two
objects we want to calculate.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.170
The mean predicted state X and
the state prediction covariance P.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.420
This time we start at the point where we
already have the predicted sigma points.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.390
This is a vector where you can put
in the weights for the sigma points.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.620
This is the vector for
the predicted state mean and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.960
this is the matrix for
the state prediction covariance.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.910
Good luck with this quiz.

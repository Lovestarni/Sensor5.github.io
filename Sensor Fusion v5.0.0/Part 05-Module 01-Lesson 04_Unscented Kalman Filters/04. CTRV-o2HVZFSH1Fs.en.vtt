00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.500
Now, let's take a look at how
the assumption of a circular motion

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.190
leads to a process model.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.270
So in this example,
at time k, the car's here.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.935
The goal of the process model f is to
predict where the car is at time k + 1.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.531
Written as an equation,
it looks like this.

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:20.960
The process model f predicts
the state at time step k + 1.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.020
Given the state at time step k and

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.330
a noise vector nu k,
this is the function we want to find.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.420
What we want to do now is
derive this process model.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.010
I will show you a very general and,
therefore, powerful approach.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.770
You will be able to use this approach
to derive process models for

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.650
many, many real world problems.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.290
We cannot directly write down the
process model simply by looking at this

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.250
figure.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.980
But we can say something about
the change rate of the state x,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.130
called x dot.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.950
&gt;From the geometric relations,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.370
we can directly derive how the change
rate x dot depends on the state x.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.650
This is a differential equation.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.650
What I would like you to do now is
derive this differential equation.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.375
The goal is to express each of
the five time derivatives of the state,

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:12.530
a dependency of any of
the state elements.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.710
I'll show you an example, Px dot is
the same as the velocity in x direction.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.560
Unfortunately, the velocity
in x direction

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.450
is not part of the state vector,
otherwise, I would be finished already.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.220
But the speed V and the yawing of psi
are both elements of the state vector.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.610
And if I look at this triangle,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.217
I can identify that Vx
= cosine psi times V.

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:42.410
Now, go ahead and
pick the correct terms for

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.220
the four remaining change
rates of the state.

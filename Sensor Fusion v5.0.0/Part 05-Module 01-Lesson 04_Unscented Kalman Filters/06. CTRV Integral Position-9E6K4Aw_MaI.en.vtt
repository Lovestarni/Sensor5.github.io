00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.470
So, you already solved the last
three rows, that's great.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.130
For the first two rows,
we actually have to solve the integral.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.430
There is no way around this time.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.440
First, let's insert the assumption
that the velocity v is a constant.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.779
So we can move the velocity at time
k as a constant before the integral.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.974
Also, we can explicitly express psi
as a function of t using again,

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:28.994
the assumption of a constant yaw rate.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.881
After the video,
take a moment to look at this term and

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.840
try to figure out what's going on here?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.850
For the first two rows we now
have an explicit function of t.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.060
All other variables are constants.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.500
So now it is possible to
solve these integrals.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.530
You can look up the solution of
these integrals in a text book or

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.150
you can solve them with an online tool.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.630
You will find a link below the video.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.710
Consider this a bonus question for

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.620
those who are really good
in solving integrals.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.120
I don't really expect you to
solve this integral on the fly.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.750
Unless of course you think you can.

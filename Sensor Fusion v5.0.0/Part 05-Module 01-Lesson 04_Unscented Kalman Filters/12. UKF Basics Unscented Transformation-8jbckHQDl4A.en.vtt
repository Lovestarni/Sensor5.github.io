00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.269
The end center transformation solves
this problem using sigma points.

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:06.709
What are these sigma points,
and how do they help us?

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.410
It can be difficult to transform
the whole state distribution through

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.359
a nonlinear function.

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.619
But it is very easy to transform
individual points of the state space

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.480
through the non-linear function, and
this is what sigma points are for.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.570
The sigma points are chosen around the
mean state and in a certain relation to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.510
the standard deviation signal
of every state dimension.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.649
This is why these points
are called sigma points.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.439
This serve as representatives
of the whole distribution.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:39.849
Once you have chosen the sigma points,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.230
you just insert every single sigma
point into the non and your function f.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.619
So they will come out somewhere
here in the predictive state space.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:53.640
All you have to do now is
calculate the mean and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.880
the covariance of your
group of sigma points.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.460
This will now provide the same mean and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.840
covariance as the real
predicted distribution.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.840
But in many cases,
it gives a useful approximation.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.079
By the way, you can apply the same
technique in the linear case.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.480
In this case, you will even find
the exact solution of the sigma points.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.320
So if the process more or
less linear, the sigma point approach

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.829
provides exactly the same solution
as the standard common feature.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.780
But you would not use
sigma points here because

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.170
they are more expensive in
terms of calculation time.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.170
So let's wrap this up.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.609
This is what you really have because
of your non linear process model.

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.904
This is the best possible mean and
covariance you could use

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:44.734
if you want to keep pretending
you have a normal distribution.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.734
And this is what the sigma
points give you.

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.635
Now you know the general idea
of an unscented transformation.

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:53.215
Time to get started with
the unscented Kalman filter.

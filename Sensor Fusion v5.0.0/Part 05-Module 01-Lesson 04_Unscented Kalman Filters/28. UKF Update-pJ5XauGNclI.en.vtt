00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.349
Congrats, you have made it
almost through the UKF.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.980
This is the last step you need to learn,
and then you will be ready to

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.839
implement your own UKF and
fuse data from different sensors.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.000
This is a very powerful and
useful ability.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.399
So let's see how the final step works
and how you can update your state and

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.359
your covariance matrix
with the measurement.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.820
What we have is this, the predicted
state mean and covariance and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.320
the predicated measurement mean and
covariance.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.252
But there's one more thing that we need,
and

00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:40.990
this is the actual measurement zk+1
that we receive for the time step k+1.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.490
This is actually the first
time we really need to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.730
know the measurement values.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.630
What we needed right from the beginning
was the time of the measurement, so

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.179
we could predict to the correct time.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.158
And later, the sensor type so we could
use the correct measurement model

00:00:56.158 --> 00:00:58.298
in the measurement prediction step.

00:00:58.298 --> 00:01:01.890
But this is the first time where we
look into the measurement values.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.078
The update calculation closes
the processing chain and

00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:11.668
produces the updated state mean and
the updated state covariance matrix.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.350
These equations are exactly the same
as for the standard Kalman filter.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.064
The only difference here is how
you calculate the Kalman gain K.

00:01:21.063 --> 00:01:24.804
Here you need the cross-correlation
matrix between the predicted sigma

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:26.253
points in the state space and

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:29.960
the predicted sigma points
in the measurement space.

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:30.823
And that's it.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:35.457
With this, you're done processing
the measurement at time step k+1, and

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:39.390
you're ready to handle the next
measurement at time step k+2.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Here, we've reached the end of segmentation.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.484
So I just want to say,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.830
nice job for making it through the segmentation section.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.365
You're now able to separate obstacles from the road.

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:12.690
You learned how to use PCLs built-in functions

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.164
for performing segmentation and extraction.

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.570
Also, you implemented your own RANSAC function and used it for

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.425
doing both line and plane model fitting in the data with outliers.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:26.205
Now you're able to separate obstacle points from points on the road.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:29.879
Let's see how you can further break up your obstacle cloud and

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:34.689
identify individual cars using the Euclidean clustering algorithm.

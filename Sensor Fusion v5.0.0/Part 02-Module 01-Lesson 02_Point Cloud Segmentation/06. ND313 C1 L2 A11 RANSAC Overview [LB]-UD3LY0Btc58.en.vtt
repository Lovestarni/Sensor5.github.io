00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.309
So RANSAC. RANSAC stands for Random Sample Consensus.

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:06.959
As we were seeing before,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.585
there's different models that you can try to fit.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.180
We were just trying to fit a plane model.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.839
Here, we're going to look at this case of trying to fit a line.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.329
So here is the situation,

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.564
we have this data and we know that there's a line in it.

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:24.925
It's quite clear that there's a line right here.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.280
But the data also has a ton of outliers.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.075
So how do you figure out where that line is at?

00:00:31.074 --> 00:00:33.979
Well, if you're just trying to do something like linear regression,

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:36.529
that would take the average of all the points and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.664
also take the average of the outliers which doesn't make sense.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.320
That's going to give you this very bad line that's

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.185
not representative of this actual line that you have.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:48.590
So RANSAC is actually a method for finding

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.630
this model when you have these outliers included in your data.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.450
How RANSAC works is,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.975
so we have this Random Sample Consensus,

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:03.710
what it's doing here is it's randomly choosing a subset of our data.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.969
So these red points are randomly chosen and then it gets aligned to just that subset.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:13.510
Then so it's fitting that line,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.660
it's looking through all the points,

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.340
and seeing how close those points are to the line.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.325
So that was that distance tolerance that we were looking at previously.

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:26.170
If that distance is small enough,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.739
then it's actually included,

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.405
it becomes an inlier.

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:35.480
Then so we're doing this iteratively and we are counting how many inliers we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.329
have in the line from the iteration that

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.584
has the highest number inlier becomes our best model.

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:43.699
So here we're going through and then when

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
that green line is all sudden coming right through here,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.655
it's picking up a ton of inliers,

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:54.049
and it's going to be the best model in our case here.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.364
So RANSAC is an iterative method.

00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:58.759
So in each iteration,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.295
it randomly picks a subset of points.

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:03.394
It fits a model to that,

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:05.594
a randomly subset of points,

00:02:05.594 --> 00:02:12.000
and then the iteration with the most inliers to that model is the best one.

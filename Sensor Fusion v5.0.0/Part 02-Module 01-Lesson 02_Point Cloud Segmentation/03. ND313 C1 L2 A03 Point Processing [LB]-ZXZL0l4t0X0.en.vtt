00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
First of all, we're going to be building our own point processor.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.250
In the previous lesson,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.714
we're looking at the code for the point processor.cpp.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:13.934
Now, we're actually going to instantiate that and start filling in some of its functions.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.530
So to do this exercise,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.280
basically, we're just going to start by creating a point processor.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.304
You might remember that we're working with

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:26.204
environment.cpp and we're filling in some objects there.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:28.904
For example, we created a lidar last time,

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.065
we're scanning with that lidar and we've

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.420
created some point clouds and we're visualizing those.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.414
Now, we're actually going to create

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:37.740
a point processor object right

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.175
below where we were doing the previous work for creating a lidar.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.309
After we create that point processor,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.000
we'll then look at filling in some of its functions.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.024
The functions that the point processor has just to remind you is doing some filtering,

00:00:52.024 --> 00:00:54.769
segmentation that we're working on in this lesson,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.010
later on clustering, and it also has capabilities for loading and saving PCD files.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:05.075
The point processor also uses templates because we had different point cloud types.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.200
So in this simulation environment,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.130
we're working with point XYZ.

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:12.454
So for this exercise,

00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:14.329
basically what I want you to do,

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.959
is an environment.cpp, there's a to-do to create

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:23.179
a point processor and you can instantiate it in two ways.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.200
You can instantiate it on the heap or on the stack,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.359
really up to you.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.215
If you look at point processor,

00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:36.469
process point clouds.cpp, you can see that it's a class.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.465
You can also look at different ways for instantiating it.

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:45.180
So for this exercise here, basically,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.660
create a point processor and make sure that you can compile and run the simulator.

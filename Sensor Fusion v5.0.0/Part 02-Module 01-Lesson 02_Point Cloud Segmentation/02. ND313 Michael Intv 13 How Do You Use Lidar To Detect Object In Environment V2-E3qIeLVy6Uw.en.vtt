00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:10.529
Engineers use LiDAR really how we mentioned it before

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:19.350
by just recording the LiDAR signal driving around.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.785
We record all the data that comes back into the LiDAR.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.620
We create objects out of it or not,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.570
depending on the particular use case where

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.840
we could do stuff directly with the point cloud.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.060
We can then use the objects to track those objects,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.850
make predictions, what they do.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.225
We can use it to classify objects.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:57.390
We have certain classes that the LiDAR using Neural Network can detect and distinguish.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.439
The segmentation is saying okay,

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.795
this particular thing belongs to one object.

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.070
This belongs to the ground plane,

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:11.599
this belongs to a tree or so.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:18.539
So you associate certain points with objects and then say okay,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.710
this is one object,

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.214
that set of points and this is another object,

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.695
a set of objects or another object.

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:30.839
This is how this basically works.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:11.554
Yes we segment out of the ground plane because we want to know the height above ground,

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:15.629
and for the different objects,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.039
and so there you need to know where is the ground

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.515
and this is where we segment out ground plane.

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:23.935
Also from sensor fusion perspective,

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:28.964
the ground plane is important because that's the road,

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:31.309
because then you can say, okay,

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.109
is the road is free space.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.329
You also want to know for example,

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.789
you get reflections of lane markings,

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:47.259
so you have all those lane markings that are in the ground plane as separate objects.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.030
Yeah, we generally do that.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.339
Hills effect lidar obviously in terms of field of view.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.130
You do not see over the crown of

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.869
a hill usually until you are relatively feet far up.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.015
Other than that, you can actually detect the slope.

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.879
There are ways of detecting the slope of the hill with lidar.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:22.274
I wouldn't say it affects the lidar,

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:27.210
it is just something in the environment that you would detect.

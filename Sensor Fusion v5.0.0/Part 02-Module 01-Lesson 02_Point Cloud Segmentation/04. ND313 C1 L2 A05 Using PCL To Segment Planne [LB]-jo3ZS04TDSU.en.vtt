00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Inside the point processor class,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:06.000
there's actually a method for doing a segment plane.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.120
We'll be looking at this in filling it in.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.489
The things to take note here are that we're going to be using a template,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.960
so pointT to represent any type the point cloud here we're doing the point XYZ,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.679
and we're going to have some arguments that go along with this,

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.114
and we have these max iterations in distance tolerance.

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:28.429
So we'll be talking a little bit more about this and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.850
how it kind of affects the data that we're generating.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.079
But basically, we're going to be creating this list of inliers,

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.000
and this is going to contain its elicit ints.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.234
It's all the indices from that point cloud that actually belong to this plane.

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:47.490
So that's what we're going to be generating from this function.

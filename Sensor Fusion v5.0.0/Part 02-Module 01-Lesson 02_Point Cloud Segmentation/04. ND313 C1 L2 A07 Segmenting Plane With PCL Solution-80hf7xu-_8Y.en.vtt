00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
So if we're looking at the solution,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:07.154
what I'm actually going to be doing is in this function segment plane.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:13.245
This is very similar to what was being done from the PCL documentation.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.570
So let's go ahead and look at this.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.445
I create this seg object.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:21.285
So this is a pcl SACSegmentation,

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:23.655
and we're using point T here because

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:28.380
our point processor is defining this template point T for us.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.004
That way you can pass in any type of point,

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.729
whether it's point XYZ,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.734
point XYZI, point XYZRGB,

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.445
and they'll still be able to handle it.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:41.200
Then I'm defining this inliers, and this is,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.615
again, this PCL type point indices.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.570
This is what we'll be using later to actually

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.340
separate the pointCloud and break it up into pieces.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.495
We have coefficients, and this is actually defining the coefficients of our model.

00:00:56.494 --> 00:01:03.439
We look and we see that we're defining seg setModelType as a SACMODEL_PLANE.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.370
So these coefficients will actually be defining what this plane is,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.915
and you could use it if you want to actually render this plane in the PCL viewer.

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:16.365
The other parameters are,

00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:18.125
we set optimized coefficients.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:20.510
It's true, we want to try to get this best model and this is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.710
actually optional that we can see from the documentation.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.709
We're using RANSAC, and this is key here.

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.959
A RANSAC is like the secret sauce behind all this segmentation,

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.684
this Random Sample Consensus,

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.150
and later we'll actually be really diving in

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.000
and seeing how the RANSAC works under the hood.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.019
Max iterations for the seg object.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:44.509
We set max iterations and set distance threshold.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.060
This is some key arguments,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.040
and it's actually arguments that are being passed

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.695
directly into our function here for a segment plane.

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:54.944
We have these max iterations in distance threshold.

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:57.574
This is actually key to RANSAC itself.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:01.730
So we'll be talking a little bit about this in a bit.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.924
But after we go through and we set up all the hyperparameters for the seg object,

00:02:07.924 --> 00:02:10.909
we're ready to give it some key information.

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.189
So we want it to do segmentation on

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.740
our Cloud which we're passing in to the function itself,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.480
it's one of the key arguments.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.614
Then what we want to generate is these inliers and coefficients.

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:25.340
We're not actually going to be using coefficients in this case,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.460
it's nice that we have it.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.245
You could use it to render the plane if you wanted,

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:32.480
but what we're really interested in is these inliers,

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:37.524
because we're going to use those to separate the pointCloud into two pieces.

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:39.590
Then we look at this.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.805
So we're passing in inliers by reference here.

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:45.885
So we created it up here, we pass it in,

00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:49.799
and this seg.segment is able to do all the processing on it.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.325
We're dereferencing it here because it's a pointer,

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:57.319
and then inlier pointer is going to point to all this list of indices

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.009
that belong to the plane that we found by doing RANSAC.

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.250
If inliers indices.size is zero,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.134
that means we actually didn't find any model that can fit this data.

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:21.919
So now, we're actually ready to move on and we have our inliers,

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.289
and we're actually ready to start separating our Cloud.

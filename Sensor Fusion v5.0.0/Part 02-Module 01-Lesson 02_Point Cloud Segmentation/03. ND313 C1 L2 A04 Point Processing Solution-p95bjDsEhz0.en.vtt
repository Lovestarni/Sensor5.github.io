00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.900
So let's look at some ways that we can actually instantiate this point processor now.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.554
Going back to my code over here,

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:15.015
one possible way is just to instantiate on the stack.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.155
So I could just actually do process point clouds.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:22.675
My template type here is going to be a PCL point XYZ,

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.964
and then I can just call it a point processor.

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:29.054
Another way is we could actually do it on the heap.

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:33.810
So one solution then would be to still have that declaration,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.890
and now we're doing a pointer,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.380
and we're going to be using a new keyword here to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.830
do a point processor clouds PCL point XYZ,

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.725
and then use these open parentheses to instantiate it.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.179
So you can do either way in this case.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.634
Then when I create this point processor,

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:56.429
I just want to make sure that everything is able to build,

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.719
and then make sure that that executable is able to be generated.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.644
Cool. So now that we have this point processor,

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:12.450
let's look at ways that we can actually start putting it to use.

Welcome to the segmentation lesson.

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:06.870
Here, we want to be able to locate obstacles in our scene.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.634
This also means that some objects in our scene are not obstacles.

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:13.169
So what would be objects that appear in our PCD,

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:14.460
but are not obstacles.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.015
For the most part, any free space on the road is not obstacle.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:20.580
If the road is flat, it's fairly straightforward to

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.219
pick out road points from non-road points.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:25.320
To do this, we'll use a method called

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.754
planar segmentation which uses the RANSAC algorithm.

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:31.660
Let's check out how this all works.

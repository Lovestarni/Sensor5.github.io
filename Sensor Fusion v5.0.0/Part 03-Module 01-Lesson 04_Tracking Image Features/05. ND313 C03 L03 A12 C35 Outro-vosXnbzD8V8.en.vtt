00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
So welcome to the end of this section.

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.125
You've made it through, congratulations to this.

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:07.259
Now you have a solid understanding about key points, about descriptors,

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
about matching methods, and also about ways to evaluate the results.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.300
Now, the figure in the last section showed

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.045
quite some differences between the various descriptive types;

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:18.809
with SIFT on the one hand performing best and Brisk on the other hand showing

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:19.949
a very quick increase in

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.265
the false positive rate and the receiver operating characteristic.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:24.615
Now, the big question is,

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:26.859
what are the best methods for our purpose?

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.219
We want to find matches on the back of the preceding vehicle.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:30.299
That means the tailgate,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.949
license plate, lights, etc.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.929
Now, which detected a script recombination will

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.225
perform best in terms of matching quality,

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:38.370
accuracy, and also speed?

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:42.879
Let's find out together in the Midterm Project which is about to come up.

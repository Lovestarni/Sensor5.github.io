00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
Now, welcome to this next section which is really going to be fun for you.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:06.599
I want to introduce you to a new class of algorithms called descriptors,

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.820
which we can use to uniquely describe key points,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.384
so we can easily find them again another images.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:12.839
Now, detectors and descriptors,

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.800
they are really popular in the research community.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.594
One thing you need in order to have a successful descriptor

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:21.765
next to super performance is a funny name of some kind.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.105
Use fast, or daisy, or sift,

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.030
or brisk, or even freak, and you'll make the day.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.005
Now, in this section, I will introduce you to another classical computer vision,

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.104
which is called Sift Descriptor.

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:34.699
This method has been proposed 20 years ago,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.510
and it is still one of the best methods around to locate and describe key points.

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:41.679
Sift basically made panoramic image searching possible for example.

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.960
Now, the family to which sift belongs is called,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.064
History of Oriented Gradients or HOG for short.

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:50.239
The problem with HOG methods is that they are based on the image gradient,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.740
and you know from Zhao and Tomas,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.109
that this is slow and not suitable for real-time performance.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.039
Now, on the second part of this section,

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.310
I want to introduce you to another family called Binary Detectors,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.895
which avoid gradients completely and others super-fast.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:06.329
One famous family member here is the brisk method.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.924
Which we'll take a look at in greater detail further down in this section here.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:11.530
Now, once you understood descriptors,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.030
you have two very powerful tools in your hands and you can

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.579
locate and match high-quality key points really fast.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.399
That means there's a large number of

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.205
cool apps you will be able to develop based on those two concepts.

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:26.599
For example, a collision of vital systems as you will see later in the course.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:31.354
Also Binary Detectors make it really possible to run algorithms on your smartphone.

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:34.250
So please take a closer look at both methods here;

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.489
detectors and descriptors, and see you later in this section.

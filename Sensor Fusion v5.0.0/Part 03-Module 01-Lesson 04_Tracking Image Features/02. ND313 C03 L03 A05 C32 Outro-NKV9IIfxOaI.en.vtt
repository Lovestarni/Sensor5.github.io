00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Now, before we move on to the next section which is

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.110
about several contemporary key point detectors,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.355
I have a task for you here.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.230
Now, in the last example, you saw the output of

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.929
the Harris detector which is basically a collection of bright and dark

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.240
patches.The next step now is to locate

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.449
key points in the image which satisfy two important conditions.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.469
First, they should give the highest columnist in the local neighborhood and second,

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.619
they should not overlap too much with other key points around them to

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.980
avoid too many points clustering in a small neighborhood.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.850
Such a technique is called non-maximum suppression or NMS.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.179
I want you to find a way to apply this to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.954
the Harris response image and locate some key points.

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:38.644
When you're finished, please store those key points in a C++ vector.

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:43.210
Look up the OpenCV key point data type for some details on the required format.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.105
The result of your work should resemble the image which is given below this video.

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:50.489
Okay. So see you in the next section once you've finished here.

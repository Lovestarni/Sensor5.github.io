00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Now here's the place to test your knowledge and match

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.594
two sets of key points by comparing the descriptors.

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:08.638
We'll be focusing on BRISK and on SIFT in this exercise,

00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:11.669
and also keypoints and descriptors have been precomputed,

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.294
so you will be working on datasets we load from file.

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:16.980
Now the first task for you is know the BRISK small

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.789
datasets with a cross-check option turned off and then turned on.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.609
Look at the visualized key point matches and also at the number of

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.879
matched pairs and describe your results in a short text to us.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.699
Second task, at the K nearest neighbor matching,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.914
you should use the kNN match function in OpenCV for this with K set to two.

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:38.850
Then, implement the descriptor distance ratio to filter out ambiguous matches.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880
When you're done, visualize the results,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.160
count the percentage of discarded matches for

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.654
both the BRISK small and the BRISK large data set and,

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.689
again, describe the observations to us in a few sentences.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:53.030
Last task, use both brute force matching and FLANN

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.480
matching on the BRISK large and on the SIFT data set and also,

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.549
again, describe your observations to us.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.759
Now the idea here is to familiarize you with typical matching results with

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.469
problems and mismatches that will occur and how to mitigate their influence.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:06.920
By describing your observations,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.918
you will be forced to concentrate not only on the obvious,

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:13.609
but also on the small stuff that might easily be missed on a quick glance.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.719
So look closely when comparing those matches and have fun with it, and see you soon.

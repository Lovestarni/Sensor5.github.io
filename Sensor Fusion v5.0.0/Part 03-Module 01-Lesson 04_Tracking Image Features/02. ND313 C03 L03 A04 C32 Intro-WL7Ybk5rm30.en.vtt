00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Now welcome back in this section on Detecting Harris Corners.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.349
I hope you like the exercise and

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:07.354
computing gradients with the Sobel operator in the last section.

00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:08.880
Now what we want to do here now,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.440
is to use those gradients to define a function for uniqueness or columnists,

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.800
which gives us a set of key points in an image that we can use for tracking.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.170
Now one of the most famous methods to detect

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.840
such points is the so-called Harris Corner Detector,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.509
which dates way back to the 1980's but it's still used in many applications today.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.410
Now the basic idea of this detector is to look for areas of significant change in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.329
the image by evaluating a local neighborhood around each pixel and based on this concept,

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.909
Harris to find a so-called colonists measure,

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:41.149
which takes the image gradients as input and provides a number as

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.500
output that is high at locations where there is change in all directions.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.409
The reason why you should learn how the Harris Detector works is that,

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.109
it teaches several basic computer vision concepts

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.630
and gives you an understanding of the concept of key points,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.225
and this helps you understand and also appreciate

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:59.530
the other concepts which we will take a look at later in this course.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.064
Okay, so that's it for the intro,

00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:04.030
now it's your turn to locate some corners.

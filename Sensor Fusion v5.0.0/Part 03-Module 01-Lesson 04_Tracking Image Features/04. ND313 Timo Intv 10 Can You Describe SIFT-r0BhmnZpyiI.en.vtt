00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.419
So stiffness basically just a way to detect texture patterns that are

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.269
repetitive that you can basically match against in either in

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.050
the same image or in another image to build up correspondences,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.789
and it works by looking at the orientation of edges,

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.219
and then looking at those edges basically in a specific special window.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.570
Keep on tracking is important if you want to, for instance,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.308
reconstruct or do a larger reconstruction based on many images,

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.530
but it's not important just for self-driving cars,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.414
it's also about if you take your cell phone and basically swipe it through the scene,

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:49.460
you can basically take snapshots and then stitch them all

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.655
together and create one panoramic image for instance.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:54.530
For that, you basically need to find

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.399
the same image part in all the pictures and link them together,

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.269
and that is basically also what key point tracking does,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.200
is basically keeping the same texture structure throughout a sequence of images.

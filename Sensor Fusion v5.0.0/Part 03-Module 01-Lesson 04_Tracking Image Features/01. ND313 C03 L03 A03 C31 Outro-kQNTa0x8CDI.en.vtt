00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Okay. So you're at the end of the section and you now know how

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.669
image gradients look like and what are Sobel operator is,

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.629
and by applying those to an image you can strip away uniform content and what

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.800
remains are pixels whose neighborhood changes quickly when moving away from them.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.000
In this last quiz,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.039
please compute an image matrix which shows

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.419
the gradient magnitude for each pixel position,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.300
and when doing this you will notice that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.225
the resulting image contains lots of unwanted noise.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.010
So what you also should do is apply

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.190
some Gaussian smoothing before computing the Sobel operator,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.530
an experiment with a degree of smoothing.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.120
Visualize the resulting images and describe your observation to us.

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.449
When you have finished let's move on to the next section which is about using

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.440
this gradient image to detect corners which will be our first key points.

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:45.960
So have fun with the exercise and see you shortly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
So in this section, we will take a close look at

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.250
several ways to describe the robustness of keypoint detectors.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.745
Imagine, you're detecting some key points on my coffee cup here.

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:12.629
Another cup rotates, and you still want to locate and match the key points, for example,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.040
the light host corners,

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.934
after rotation to the ones before the rotation.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.049
Now, if your detector is rotation invariant,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.400
it will be able to do this.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.129
Now, I mention the cup moving away from the camera,

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.250
and the key points are getting smaller and smaller,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.184
and this means they are subject to a scale change.

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:31.439
Also, another thing that could happen would be a change in scene illumination.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.700
If I block out the light,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.455
areas get darker, and we have a change in intensity.

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:38.429
Lastly, imagine a perspective transformation that could

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.469
change the shape of the key points on the image plane.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.399
Now, a perfect detector would be able to

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.689
compensate for all those effects, and in the following,

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.269
we will take a close look at them,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.520
including a way to automatically select the best scale level,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.785
that means the size for a key point.

00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:57.454
Lastly, I will give you an overview of traditional and contemporary key point detectors.

00:00:57.454 --> 00:01:00.949
Oh, and there will be a coding task for you to complete at the end of this section.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.280
So go ahead and we'll meet again at the bottom of this page.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
Let's talk Kalman filters.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.679
You've seen Kalman filters in the context of localization,

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:06.434
but they're much more general.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:11.550
You can apply them to almost any tracking problem in physical systems.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.350
So, you can talk about motion models,

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.179
we're going to talk about sensor fusion,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.309
and apply Kalman filters in their contexts,

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.125
and to throw one more wrench,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.160
you're going to do it in C++.

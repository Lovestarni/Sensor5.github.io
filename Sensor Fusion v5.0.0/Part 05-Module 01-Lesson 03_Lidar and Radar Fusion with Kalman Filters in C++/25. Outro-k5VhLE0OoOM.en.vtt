00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.207
Thank you, Andrei, for the fun
lesson on extended Kalman filters.

00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:05.540
&gt;&gt; My pleasure.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.490
&gt;&gt; Can you give us a quick summary one
more time of all of this information?

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.750
&gt;&gt; At the high level, you've
designed the fusion system that can

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.850
incorporate measurements provided
by laser and radar sensors.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.510
Thus we can estimate
pedestrians' position and speed.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.735
Along the way, you learned how to
implement a Kalman filter in 2D.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.210
And you also started working
with nonlinear measurement models.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.610
&gt;&gt; Yes, that was a great start.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.800
I'll help you dive deeper into
handling nonlinear motion,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.460
such as a turning car or bicycle.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.100
You'll build something called
an unscented Kalman filter,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.970
which is a very powerful and
flexible technique for sensor fusion.

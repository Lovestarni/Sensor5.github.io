00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.110
So how do I put this together?

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.710
I can start from my Kalman Filter,
previously described.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.750
What I change is I simply use
my non-linear function, f(x),

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.200
to predict the state.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.620
And h(x) to compute
the measurement error here.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.670
Additionally, the state transition
matrix F and the measurement matrix

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.660
H are replaced by corresponding
Jacobians: Fj, and Hj.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.020
So first, we have to compute
these Jacobian matrices.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.930
Because the linearization points change,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.640
I have to recompute the Jacobians
at every point in time.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.930
So for the Extended Kalman Filter,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.805
I first linearize the nonlinear
prediction and measurement functions.

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:51.109
And then I just use the same
mechanism to estimate the new state.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.787
In the next quiz, I want you to compare
filters with extended filters for

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.075
a particular example.

00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.669
Congratulations, you've just
implemented the C++ comma filter for

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.570
one dimensional tracking problem.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.169
But now let's say that our vehicle

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.480
sounds are able to provide
the measurements in 2D.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.490
Here we are in the lesson map.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.440
At this point we need to
rethink the predictions.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.050
step.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.160
And first, we have define
the state transition matrix, F,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.359
and the process covariance matrix, Q.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.369
So we have the following changes.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.390
First, as our pedestrian is moving along
both horizontal and vertical directions.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.450
We want to estimate now a 2D
position and 2D velocity.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.478
So we have a 4D state vector.

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:45.429
Xx is equal to Px, Py, Vx, Vy.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.899
Second we'll use the same linear
motion model with the custom velocity.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.739
So, the new x and
y position will be the old positions +

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.520
the displacement, which is the same
as the velocity * delta t.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.000
The velocity along both x and
y axes stays the same.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.160
So, this gives us the following
state transition equation.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.200
Expressed in a matrix form as you
can see here and below this video.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.799
The third main change is that
delta t is not constant anymore.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.224
In reality,
the time elapsed between two.

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:23.155
Two consecutive observations might vary.

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:25.795
But let's look a bit closer
at the MOTION NOISE,

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:29.225
because you didn't really use
this before with Sebastian.

00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:32.384
I want to challenge your
intuition with two quizzes.

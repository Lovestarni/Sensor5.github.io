00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.229
Here we are in the lesson map.

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:04.730
So far,
we have defined the motion model.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.210
At this point, let's say a Lidar
measurement has come in.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.220
Now, let's design our measurement
model for a laser sensor in 2D.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.179
This will involve defining
the right measurement vector,

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:21.120
Z, the measurement matrix H,
and the covariance matrix, R.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.609
The Lidar sensor output
is a point cloud, but for

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.359
simplicity we consider here
that we already analyzed

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.298
the point cloud to compute the 2D
location of the pedestrian.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:36.323
So our measurement vector
Z is just Px and Py.

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:42.213
We also know that our state is
a 4D vector of Px, Py and Vx, Vy.

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:46.505
Now, I would like you to derive
the right measurement matrix H,

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:51.450
which is the projection from a 4D
state to a 2D observation state.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.590
Take a look at the possible
matrices below.

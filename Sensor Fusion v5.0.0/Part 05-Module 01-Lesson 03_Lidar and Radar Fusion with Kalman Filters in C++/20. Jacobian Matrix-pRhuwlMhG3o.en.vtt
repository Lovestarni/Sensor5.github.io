00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.140
And, as you see here,
I use the predicted state to read

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.040
the four parameters, px, py, vx, vy.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.070
And then I just use them to
compute each Jacobian element

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.420
according to the matrix definition
I've showed you before.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.800
In order to make it easier,
I precompute some of the terms like c1,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.350
c2 and c3 to avoid repeated
computations in the matrix.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.720
Here is how I compute the Jacobian and
here is the result.

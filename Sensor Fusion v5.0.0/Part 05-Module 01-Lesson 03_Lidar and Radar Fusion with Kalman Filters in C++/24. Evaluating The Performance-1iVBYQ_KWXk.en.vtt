00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.560
And here is my code.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.258
I checked the invalid inputs here.

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:08.517
For example, if the two lists are not the 
same size. &lt;end of thought&gt;

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:11.095
&lt;new thought&gt; I accumulate the square of
the residuals

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:15.420
for each pair estimation[i] and
ground_truth[i].

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.590
Then I compute the mean here and

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.470
finally I get the square root here before
returning the result.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.058
So for these specific estimations and
ground_truths,

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:32.512
the resultant mean squared error is 
0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1.

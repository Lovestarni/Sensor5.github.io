00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.090
Here is how my code looks.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.590
It exactly implements step by step,
all the equations for the prediction and

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.800
measurement update.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.660
This includes the error calculation,
given my new measurement z.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.150
The 'H' matrix transposed, the 'S' matrix 
and its inverse, the Kalman gain, and the
newupdated state 'x', and covariance 'P'.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.430
And the new updated state x,
and covariance p.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.370
These are the prediction equations
exactly as they are described in

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.080
The Kalman filter algorithm.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.195
Let's have a look at
the prediction function over here.

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.275
I've got another question for you.

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:37.865
Why do we not mention the process
noise in the state prediction line

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:41.895
here, in the code, although state
transition function has one?

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.990
Bounding boxes are relatively easy way of dealing with

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.670
objects because then you just associate the points to a bounding box or now if you say,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.650
okay, this object is in the bounding box,

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:21.094
okay, this is now pedestrian,

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:23.789
this point is not on the bounding box,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.035
this is something else.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.094
It is a relatively easy way of dealing with it.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:33.500
The issue though is that you are making model assumptions about

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.515
the size of the bounding box that you assign to let say a car,

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:41.450
or to a pedestrian,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.790
and if this violates the assumptions of the bounding box,

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.629
then things tend to look somehow strange.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:01:00.859
Well, you could track everything or you could track sort of out bounding polygon.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.479
We're doing that too,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.200
where we can really follow the polygons,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.350
which is a much more precise thing.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:15.719
You could actually track voxels,

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:23.629
you could go with the individual points,

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:26.344
but that's way too computationally intensive,

00:01:26.344 --> 00:01:28.769
that's something you do not want to do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Welcome to the clustering lesson.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.800
You have a way to segment points and

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.830
recognize which ones represent obstacles for your car.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.039
It would be great to break up and group obstacle points

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.264
to identify which points belong to different cars.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:19.289
One way to do that grouping in clustered point data is called the Euclidean clustering.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.419
The idea is you associate groups of points by how close they are.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.250
You'll also look at building your own KD tree to make finding nearest neighbors search

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.009
quick inefficient to get started let's talk

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.745
about how you can implement Euclidean clustering.

00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.265
All right. So here's the overview for clustering.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:41.005
We're going to group points by how close they are to each other,

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.945
we're going to be using this data structure called a KD tree and it's

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.439
really going to help us a speedup the closest neighbor search.

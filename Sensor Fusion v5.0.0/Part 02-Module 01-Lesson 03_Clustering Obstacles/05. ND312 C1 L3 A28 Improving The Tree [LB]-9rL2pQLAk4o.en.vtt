00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.944
Let's talk about some ways for improving the Tree real quick.

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:09.675
Here in the example we're just naively inserting points arbitrarily.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.980
But, if we can actually balance the Tree better,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.469
if we insert points that are evenly splitting the region for each dimension.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:20.704
So how do you do this?

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:23.909
Well, that means that you would actually sort the points,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.300
let's say first by the X component,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.670
and then you pick the median value and the insert that point into the Tree.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.524
Next you'd sort the points based on the Y values,

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.390
and then insert the median for the Y's.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.679
What this does is it'll actually create a really balanced KD Tree,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.750
and having a more balanced Tree,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.310
means it's going to more effectively be able to search for points later on,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.170
because it'll be able to more evenly split your regions apart.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.984
So an example in our 2D case is inserting points.

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:00.929
Well, with our four points,

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.240
we'd be sorting them by the X components,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.980
and then insert the X median.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.410
Then with those three remaining points,

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.079
we'll sort them based on the Y values and then insert the Y median,

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:17.700
and then finally we'd go X median and then just the last point.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.260
If you have an even number of points and you're trying to pick the median,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.435
you can just pick the lower median.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:25.100
So this is how you can create

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.609
a more balanced Tree that'll help you out later on when you're

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.549
trying to have the most efficient search time

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.890
for doing nearest neighbor with your KD tree.

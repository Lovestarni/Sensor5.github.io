00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Congratulations.

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:04.019
You've now been able to find bounding boxes

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.869
that each coincide with the different cars on the highway.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.294
You did this by using a Lidar to create a high resolution point Clouds,

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:15.974
and then segmented that point Cloud into two parts; road and obstacles.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.390
Finally, you use Euclidean clustering to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.539
breakup the Obstacle Point Cloud into separate entities.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.174
In this case, the different cars on the road and then put bounding boxes around them.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.559
You have graduated from the highway simulator,

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.355
and you're now ready to tackle Real Point Cloud Data from self driving cars.

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:33.884
Check out the next lesson,

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:36.579
working with Real Point Cloud Data.

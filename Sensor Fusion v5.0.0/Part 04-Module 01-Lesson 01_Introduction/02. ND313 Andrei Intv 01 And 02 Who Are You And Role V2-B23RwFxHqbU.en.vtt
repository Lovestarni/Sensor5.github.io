00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
I'm Andrei Vatavu.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.645
I'm a sensor fusion engineer and I'm a part of a team taking care of

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:12.329
combining data provided by different sensors such as LIDAR,

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.554
radars, cameras, and all of this

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:20.745
to get a more consistent representation of the environment.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.880
Including static, dynamic objects,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.619
traffic lights, free-space and other traffic participants.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.655
This is a common project between Mercedes Benz and Porsche

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:36.914
to build a self-driving car and of course,

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:39.280
put it into production

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.330
I've been doing various tasks including object tracking and object detection,

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.833
however, if we talk about the radar sensor itself,

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:57.725
there is a dedicated team that builds the radar from

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:03.859
scratch and then we get measurements such as range,

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.260
range rate, angle to apply our sensor fusion algorithms.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.605
Probably, it has to be mentioned that

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:19.115
the received information from the radar interface is not prefiltered,

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:22.489
but it's rather our sense of

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:30.640
fusion task to do the object tracking by using this radar information.

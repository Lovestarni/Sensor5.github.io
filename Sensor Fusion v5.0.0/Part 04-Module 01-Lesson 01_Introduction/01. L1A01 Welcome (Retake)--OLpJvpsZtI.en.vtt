Hi, this is Abdullah Zedi.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:06.960
I'm the Principal Radar Design Engineer, at Metawave Corporation.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.240
I'm excited to be here at Udacity as your instructor for Radar Sensor Fusion Program.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.155
In this course, we will be talking about how radar makes it easy,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.560
to determine range and velocity of the targets, hence,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.879
making it an essential sensor for any level of self-driving.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.869
Further, we will be covering the physics behind its operation,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.575
which will include; RF and digital signal processing.

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:35.549
Towards the end, we will explore the tracking and clustering algorithms,

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.048
that give radar detection,

00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:42.240
more sense in terms of different driving scenario. Let's begin.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Fusion is how we merge together data from

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.965
different sensors in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the environment.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:12.780
In particular, sensor fusion relies on the notion of uncertainty.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.970
We can't ever be completely certain about the state of any object in our environment.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.460
However, we can use mathematical filters to fuse together data from different types of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.325
sensors in order to reduce our uncertainty and increase the accuracy of our estimates.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:36.195
Most filters rely on a prediction update cycle in which we first predict or estimate

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:39.420
the position of different objects in our environment and then we

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.265
update those predictions using actual sensor measurements.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:45.350
We continue this cycle forever,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.880
predicting and then updating,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.430
predicting and the updating in order to gain in

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.080
increasingly accurate picture of our surrounding environment.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.715
Some of the factors to consider when selecting

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:59.180
a filter for sensor fusion include whether that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.350
filter operates in continuous or discrete measurement space

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.205
and how that filter handles linearity.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:09.935
Sensors often provide us data in continuous form,

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:14.590
but it can often be easier for filters to process data in discrete form.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.960
That conversion from continuous measurements to discrete measurements

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.055
can often introduce its own type of uncertainty and imprecision.

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:25.700
Linearity means whether an object is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.945
moving in a straight line or whether it's moving in a non-linear fashion.

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:33.335
Kalman filters, which will study in this program,

00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:37.595
operate effectively on vehicles that are moving in a straight line,

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:43.165
but encounter problems when vehicles begin to exhibit non-linear curved motion.

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:45.360
No type of filter is perfect,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.665
but by choosing a good filter and implementing it correctly,

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:51.890
we can reduce the amount of uncertainty in our sensor measurements

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.190
and gain a more complete understanding of our surrounding environment.

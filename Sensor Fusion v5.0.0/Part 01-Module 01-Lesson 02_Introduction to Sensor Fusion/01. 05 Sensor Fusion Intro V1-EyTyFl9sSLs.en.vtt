00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Sensor fusion is part of the perception stack.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.060
In particular, sensor fusion involves many different sensor modalities

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.519
or types of sensors that help a robot or a computer perceive its surrounding environment.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.829
Different sensors have their own strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:22.439
In this program, you'll learn about the strengths and weaknesses of LiDAR,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.615
camera and radar sensors.

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:28.604
But all sensors have their own different types of strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:32.535
You'll also learn how to fuse together sensor data.

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:35.744
If a camera sees an object in the distance

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.625
and a radar also sees an object in the distance,

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:43.990
it can be difficult to know if that's the same object or two different objects.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.910
That's why we fuse together sensor data

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.134
in order to gain a cohesive understanding of the world.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:53.479
This fusion involves uncertainty.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.640
It's impossible to know exactly what the world around us looks like.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.145
Even with my own eyes,

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.505
if I see an object in the distance,

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.165
I have a sense of how far away it is but I don't know for certain.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:10.115
I have an uncertainty bound around my perception of the distance of that object.

00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:12.744
Over the course of this Nanodegree Program,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:17.689
you'll learn how to work with many different types of sensors and how to fuse that data

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.420
together and how to account for the uncertainty that's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.540
inherent in perception in sensor fusion in particular.

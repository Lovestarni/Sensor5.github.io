00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
Computers use many different types of sensors in order to perceive their environment.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.090
I'm going to list as many sensors as I can really really fast.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.580
Lidar, camera, radar, GNSS, IMU,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.535
speedometer, odometer, laser range finders, thermal cameras.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.340
I've run out, but I think if you search online,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.610
you'll be able to find many more types of sensors that computers use

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.345
to perceive all different types of measurements in the environment.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:28.110
Human beings also have five biological sensors that are

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.920
roughly analogous to the types of sensors that we build for machines.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.860
The five biological senses are sight,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.990
sound, smell, taste, and touch.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.450
Sight, of course, is roughly analogous to cameras.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.515
The same way cameras use ambient light in order to perceive the environment,

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.245
human beings have eyes that use ambient light

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:51.370
in order to build an understanding of our surroundings.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.500
Sound is roughly analogous to audio sensors,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.570
which can measure sound waves in order to

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.500
hear the same types of sounds that humans perceive.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.420
Smell and taste are a little

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.300
bit less common with machines but I think if you search online,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.450
you'll be able to find sensors that perceive particulate matter

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.610
that's roughly analogous to the way human beings smell and taste the world.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.185
Touch could be seen as possibly analogous to lasers or radar sensors in the way that

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.840
lasers and radar actively emit signals into

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.170
the world and then receive those signals back and of course,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.830
there are also tactile sensors that sense touch just the same way humans do.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.690
All of these different sensors help both humans and machines

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.120
perceive the surrounding environment and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.550
build a better understanding of the world that we live in.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
The word lidar is a portmanteau of the two words, light and radar.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.650
Like radar, lidar is an active sensor that uses laser beams to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.020
measure the world by sending out those beams and

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.620
measuring the beams as they're deflected back off of objects.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.240
Lidar units can have a 360-degree horizontal field

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.575
of view if they're spinning around and measuring the world in all directions.

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:28.905
Lidar beams also have a vertical field of view,

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.455
which varies depending on the lidar unit,

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:35.755
but measures how high and how low the lidar beams can detect.

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:39.335
Lidar beams are really good at measuring distance.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:41.825
They also create point clouds,

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:44.720
which are points of objects with x, y,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.350
and z coordinates and often in intensity coordinate.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.455
These points can be clustered together using

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:54.154
artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms,

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:58.070
and even sent through a neural network in order to detect

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.555
objects and draw bounding boxes around obstacles in the environment.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:07.085
One of the drawbacks of lidar is that it can often be expensive,

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:09.740
but the performance of lidar units often

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.890
justifies the high cost of putting the unit on the robot.

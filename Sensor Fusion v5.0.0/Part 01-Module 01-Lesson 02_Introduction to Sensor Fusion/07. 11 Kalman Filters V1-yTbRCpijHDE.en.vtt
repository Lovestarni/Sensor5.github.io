00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.955
Kalman filters, which we'll learn about in this program,

00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:08.090
operate well when vehicles are exhibiting linear motion,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.400
but encountered challenges when vehicles begin to exhibit nonlinear motion,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.600
curves or other difficult unpredictable types of motion.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.540
You'll learn about ways to overcome

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.370
those challenges by programming unscented or extended Kalman filters,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.975
which linearize nonlinear motion to make it easier for Kalman filters to fuse together.

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:31.780
No type of filter is perfect,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.260
but by choosing a good filter and implementing it correctly,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.840
we can reduce the inherent uncertainty in

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.310
our sensor measurements and gain a comprehensive understanding of the environment.

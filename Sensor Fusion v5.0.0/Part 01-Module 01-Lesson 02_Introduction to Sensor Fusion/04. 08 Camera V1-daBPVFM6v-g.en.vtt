00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.525
Cameras generate images from ambient white which makes cameras passive sensors.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:11.520
However, cameras are getting increasingly effective at understanding

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.070
night vision and generating data from

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.625
the little bit of light they're able to perceive in a dark environment.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:22.800
One of the chief benefits of camera images is their high resolution.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.275
Something like reading a sign or

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:29.010
a traffic signal is only really possible with a camera image.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.830
No other sensor provides that level of resolution

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.280
necessary in order to perceive the environment at that level of detail.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.750
In recent years, neural networks have become

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.075
increasingly effective tools for

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:45.355
understanding camera images and making sense of what's in the image.

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:49.130
Some of the disadvantages of camera images are measuring

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.985
distance and understanding how fast things are going.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.245
On the other hand,

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.780
cameras are very inexpensive and we have

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.810
terrific tools in order to understand the images that cameras provide us.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.629
The world is often made in ways that correspond

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:09.230
to the eyes that human beings have in order to sense the environment,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.035
which make cameras a particularly effective sensor

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:16.140
for vehicles that are trying to understand the existing world.

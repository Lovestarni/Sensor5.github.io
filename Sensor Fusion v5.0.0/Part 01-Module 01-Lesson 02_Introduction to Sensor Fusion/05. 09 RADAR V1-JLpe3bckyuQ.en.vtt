00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Radar is an active sensor that sends light waves out into

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.790
the environment and then receives those waves as they deflect back from objects.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.705
We can apply signal processing to those radar wave forms in

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:17.115
order to understand the position and velocity of objects in the environment.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:21.030
In particular, we measure position based on how long it takes for

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.960
a wave to propagate out and then return back to the radar unit.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.035
We measure velocity based on the Doppler effect,

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:30.855
the shift in frequency that a radar waveform

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:35.080
undergoes when it bounces off an object and returns back to the unit.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.110
One of the challenges of radar is its low resolution.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.890
You basically just get a signal about where an object is and how

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.675
fast it's moving with very little other information about the object.

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:48.020
On the other hand,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.130
the benefits of radar are that it's highly reliable and functions in

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.780
many different types of environments that are challenging for other types of sensors,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.630
and that radar is inexpensive and very

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.065
cost-effective to put on to many different types of robots.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:04.580
Both of these make radar

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.060
an extremely important sensor for many different types of applications.

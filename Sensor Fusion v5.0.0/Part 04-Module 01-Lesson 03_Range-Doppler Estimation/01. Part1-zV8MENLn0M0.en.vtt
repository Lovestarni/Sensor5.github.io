00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.084
Welcome to Lesson 3.

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:06.104
I hope by now we have a good understanding of the radar principles.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.060
In Lesson 3, we will learn how often CW radar

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.210
calculates a range and Doppler velocity of the targets.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.630
Further, we will introduce the Fourier transform and learn

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.870
its implementation to generate the Range/Doppler map.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.875
Any radar engineer would be required to understand

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:12.629
the linear algebra, trigonometry, statistics.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.679
So they would be able to deal with radar measurements,

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.140
given for example in the polar coordinates.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.030
At least you have to know how to apply those sine and cosine.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.850
In the context of object tracking,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.220
we used the radar information.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:32.729
Probably you can apply an extended common filter.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.609
In the context of object tracking they might require to know how to apply

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.464
the partial derivatives and those common filters

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:48.020
because we use the measurements provided by the radar.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.140
Those measurements are described by non-linear measurement functions.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.255
For common filter, those non-linear measurement functions have to be linearized.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.564
So we have to apply those partial derivatives and obtain Jacobian's.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.730
On the radar side they have to know how to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.960
get the frequency values out of the radar signals,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:16.139
and this could be applied by using Fast Fourier transforms.

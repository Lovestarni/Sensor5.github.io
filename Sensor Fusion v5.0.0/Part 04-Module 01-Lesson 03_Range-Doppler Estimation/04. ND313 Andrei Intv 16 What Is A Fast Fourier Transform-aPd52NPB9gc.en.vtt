00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.195
In general, a fast Fourier transform is used to

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:10.095
convert a time-domain signal into frequency domain signal.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.380
We use so-called fast Fourier transform

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.774
to get the frequency values out of the radar signals.

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:23.669
Specifically, we actually get a frequency spectrum.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.615
We identify the peak and that peak is related

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:32.469
to the reflected signals from other objects.

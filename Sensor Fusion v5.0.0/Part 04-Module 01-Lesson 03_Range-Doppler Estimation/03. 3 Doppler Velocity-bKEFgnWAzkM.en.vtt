00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.329
Okay. Here's the solution.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
We are given a radar which has an operating frequency of 77 gigahertz and

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.515
the task is to calculate the velocity of four targets in meter per second.

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:15.280
It has the following Doppler frequency shifts;

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.125
three kilohertz minus 4.5 kilohertz,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.469
11 kilohertz minus three kilohertz,

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.660
and we know the speed of flight.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.530
Using that, we can determine the wavelength of the signal,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.024
since we know the frequency of our signal is 77 gigahertz.

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:38.769
The wavelength of the signal is defined dividing the speed of light by frequency,

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.729
and as you are given,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:45.390
we create a vector of our Doppler shift.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.334
Using the Doppler shift and the wavelength we calculated,

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:55.180
we can determine the relative velocity for each target.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.795
Once we run the code,

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:02.120
here you get your relative velocities for all four different targets.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.700
The first target has a relative velocity of 5.8 meter per second,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.130
and the second one is minus 8.7,

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:13.399
the third target has a relative velocity of 21.42 meter per second,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.900
and the last one is minus 5.8 meter per second.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.210
We need to be careful with the sign of the velocities,

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:24.239
since they correspond to the receding and approaching targets.

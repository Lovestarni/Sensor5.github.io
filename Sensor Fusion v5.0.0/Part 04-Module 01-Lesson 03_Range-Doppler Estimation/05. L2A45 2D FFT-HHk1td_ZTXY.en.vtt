00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
So far, we have learned

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.299
about one-dimensional FFT and its application in calculating the range of the target.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.070
But using the same signal,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.574
how do we determine velocity of the target?

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.829
This is where 2D FFT comes into the picture.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.129
Going back to where we left the range FFT,

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.500
we calculated the range by implementing

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.370
the first FFT across all the samples and columns for each.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.089
Now subsequently, another FFT is implemented.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.809
This time, it is along the rows of the first FFT results.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.269
This operation measures the shift in the phase across

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.005
multiple charts which in return gives the Doppler frequency shift,

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.475
hence resolving the velocity of each target.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:43.539
As you can see after implementing the first FFT,

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.674
two targets are detected as they occupy the complete range pins.

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:50.209
On running the second FFT operation,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.230
the targets are resolved in both range and Doppler.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.274
The beauty of the two-dimensional FFT is,

00:00:57.274 --> 00:01:00.739
it directly produces an image for radar's perception.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.615
As you can see in the image,

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.075
the y-axis has a range of the target.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:09.560
The x-axis has the Doppler velocity with zero velocity in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.405
the center such that

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:15.515
all the stationary targets are centered in the middle of the spectrum.

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:20.210
The targets that appear on the negative Doppler are approaching

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:25.339
targets and the ones on the positive Doppler are the receding targets.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.005
The color intensity here reflects the strength of the return signal.

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.554
Higher the color intensity could mean

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.620
closer target or a target with a bigger radar cross section.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.670
Check this out. This is a rotated version of the range Doppler map.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.605
We just saw in the previous image.

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:46.775
This video was captured while demonstrating meta-phase long-range radar.

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:49.460
Here, we are directly capturing a road

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.684
seen by running a two-dimensional FFT on the radar's received signal.

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:58.710
Isn't it mesmerizing to see instantaneous range and velocity measurements?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
This is how the FFT output for each chirp looks

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.025
like on an amplitude versus frequency plot.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:08.460
As you see, multiple return chirps are generated,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.140
and each of them generate their own frequency peak after their FFT operation.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.339
The different peaks here correspond to the targets at different distances.

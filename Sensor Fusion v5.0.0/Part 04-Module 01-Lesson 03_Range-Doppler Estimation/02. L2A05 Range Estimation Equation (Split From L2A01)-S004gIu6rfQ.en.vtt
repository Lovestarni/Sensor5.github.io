00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
Okay. Time to do some calculations to estimate the range of the targets.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:10.410
In this image, the white car is an ego car which has radar mounted on its grill.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.679
The radar transmits the signal and receives

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.890
it back after the reflection from the orange car.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.910
How does the radar calculate the range of the orange car? Let's see.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.954
We know the electromagnetic wave travels at the speed of light.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:26.789
So if we can determine the total trip time taken by

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.494
the radar signal to hit the target and return back to the radar,

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.700
then you can calculate the range.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.395
But the question is, how do we calculate the trip time?

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:39.725
This is where FMCW comes to the rescue.

00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:43.594
FMCW radar, as learned in the earlier lesson,

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:46.324
the frequency varies linearly with time.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:50.120
By design, we are aware of the slope of the signal.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.719
So if we can calculate the shift in the signal frequency,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.829
which is here you can see in the image as given by the beat frequency,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.899
then we can estimate the shift in time,

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.104
which gives our trip time.

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:05.164
Let's look at it from the system's perspective.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:11.150
The synthesizer generates FMCW chip for a given bandwidth and chip time.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.320
Let's say the signal gets transmitted at 77 gigahertz.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.109
It goes on, hits the target,

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.545
and gets reflected back towards the receiver antenna.

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:24.805
The frequency doesn't change during the process.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:29.840
The frequency here goes into a mixer where it gets

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.390
subtracted from the mixer frequency and we get a beat signal.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.379
Point to note. If the target is stationary,

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:41.344
there is no change in the transmitted and received frequency.

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:46.909
The only shift happens at the synthesizer as it continues to ramp linearly with time.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.679
This is how the beat frequency signal appears for the different targets.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.980
Higher the beat frequency of the peak associated with the target,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.170
more is the distance.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.090
Also as you can see,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.344
the power of the signal is larger for the biggest sized targets.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:05.965
So we can see there is a pedestrian close to the radar,

00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:08.780
and then there's a truck close to it.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.099
But the power level of the truck is higher because of its larger cross-sectional area.

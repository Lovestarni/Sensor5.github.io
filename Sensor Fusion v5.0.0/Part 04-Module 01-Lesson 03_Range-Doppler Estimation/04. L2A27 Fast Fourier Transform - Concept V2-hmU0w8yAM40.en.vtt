00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Time for some fun.

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:04.750
It is time for digital signal processing.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.224
Here we will discuss how radar converts a signal from time domain to frequency domain,

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:12.744
in order to generate range and diplomats.

00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:14.449
Sounds interesting?

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.085
Fourier transform. No, no,

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:18.664
don't start panicking yet.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:20.109
For the purpose of this course,

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.160
we don't have to learn the mathematical implementation of FFT.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.570
All we need to do is understand how FFT helps in radar detections.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.765
What is Fourier transform?

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:33.340
The Fourier transform is a tool that helps convert

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.040
a time-domain signal into frequency domain,

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.670
for a better analysis of its spectral content.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.844
Let's see how it works in the most basic way.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:45.088
So Jean Baptiste Fourier,

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.100
proved the mathematical fact that,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.454
any periodic waveform can be expressed as the sum of an infinite set of sine waves.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:55.478
As the image shows,

00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:59.740
the signal in time domain has multiple sine waves associated with it.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.600
What FFT does is that,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.359
it takes the time domain signal and separates it into its different frequency components.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.825
This helps in understanding the spectral content of a signal,

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:14.829
which is important for analyzing and processing the beat frequency.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.774
This is it, it wasn't too difficult, right?

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:23.910
Let's take a look at first dimension FFT or the range of FFT.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.454
As we learned earlier,

00:01:25.454 --> 00:01:28.504
every single chirp is sampled multiple times.

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:31.969
In order to get the spectral content of the beat frequency,

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.804
we perform the FFT across all the data collected at every sample within each chirp.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:42.485
We repeat the process for all chirps to get a 2D matrix of size,

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:45.709
number of samples, into number of chirps.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.734
All the columns in the matrix corresponds to the range bins.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:55.474
The yellow bins, depict the presence of targets hence giving the range for every target.

00:01:55.474 --> 00:02:02.339
Here in the image, we can see two targets located at two different locations.

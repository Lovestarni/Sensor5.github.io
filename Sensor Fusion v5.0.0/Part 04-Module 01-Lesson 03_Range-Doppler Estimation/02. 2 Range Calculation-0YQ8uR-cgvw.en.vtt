00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Okay. So here's the solution.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.410
Here, we are trying to measure the range of the four targets,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.495
which has the following frequency shifts.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:07.903
We have zero megahertz,

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:11.654
1.1 megahertz, 13 megahertz and 24 megahertz.

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:16.875
We are also given that the maximum range a radar can detect is 300 meters,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.684
and the range resolution required is one meter.

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:25.304
So using these values, we can determine the slope of the FMCW chirp.

00:00:25.304 --> 00:00:27.314
To determine the bandwidth,

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.375
all we need to know is the range resolution.

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.825
So once you plug in the range resolution value,

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.270
we can determine the Bsweep.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.075
Similarly, as we also know that the maximum range the radar can detect is 300 meters,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.320
we can determine the time of each chirp,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.244
which is generally defined by multiplier of 5.5 years along with the total trip time.

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:55.849
Once you plug in all these values along with the beat frequency,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.734
we can determine the range for every target.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:07.569
When running the code, here you get the range for each and every target.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.309
Since in the case of first target,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.323
the beat frequency was zero megahertz,

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:17.870
we see that the target is almost right in front of the radar.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.140
The second target is at 12.1 meters away,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.739
whereas the third is at 143, and at last,

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:29.189
the last target is 264 meters away from the car.

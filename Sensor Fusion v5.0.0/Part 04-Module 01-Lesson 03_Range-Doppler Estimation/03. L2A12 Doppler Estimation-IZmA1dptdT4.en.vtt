00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Time to look at an age old phenomena called Doppler effect.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.570
Looks like a familiar sight.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.780
Some of you may have even got a speeding ticket.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.584
If so, then say thanks to the Doppler effect.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.825
What is Doppler effect? Let's take a look.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:18.050
The capability of the radar to estimate

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.385
started velocity makes it a must-have sensor for self-driving cars.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.980
The target velocity estimation helps in

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.519
better awareness of approaching and receding targets.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.509
The transmitted frequency shifts lower for the receding targets.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.309
As you can see, in the image,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.660
the wavelength increases whereas the frequency shifts higher for

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.849
an approaching target and you can see the wavelengths are much smaller.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.880
If you can calculate the shift in this Doppler frequency,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.950
we can determine the velocity as well as the direction of the targets movement.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.155
Using the given equation,

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.605
we can determine the relative velocity of the target.

00:00:57.604 --> 00:00:59.869
Going back to the same scenario,

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:03.829
but now with an additional impact of Doppler frequency shift,

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.694
which is given here by f plus fd.

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:09.294
Here's an interesting part.

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:11.040
There is a moving target,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.243
the Doppler frequency will add an additional shift in the beat frequency,

00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:18.694
which in the image which is given by this shift.

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:21.649
The beat frequency which only corresponds to the range in the case of

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.325
stationary target will now have the Doppler shift as well.

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:27.740
Although in the case of automotive radar,

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:33.169
the Doppler shift is very small in comparison to the shift in frequency due to the range,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.590
hence the Doppler velocity is calculated by measuring

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.070
the rate of change of phase across the multiple chips.

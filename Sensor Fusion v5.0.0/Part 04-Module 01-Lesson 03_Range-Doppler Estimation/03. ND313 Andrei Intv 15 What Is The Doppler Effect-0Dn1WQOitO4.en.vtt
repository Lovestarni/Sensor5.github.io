00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:09.585
The Doppler effect is a change in frequency of a wave reflected off a moving target.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.420
Just to give you an example,

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:19.035
suppose we have only one object in the scene and when the target is moving,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:24.780
then the received signal that is reflected back to the radar might arrive

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.710
earlier than expected if the target is moving towards the radar.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.630
That is because the current wave is reflected from

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.395
a position which is closer to the sensor.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:45.270
Similarly, the same signal might arrive with

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.515
a delay If the target is moving

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:53.960
away and that is also translated as having a higher or a lower frequency.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.215
This frequency difference is known as a Doppler effect.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:04.920
In our case, we use these Doppler effect to compute the velocity.

You should see results that are similar to the .gif above: the road should be segmented from the vehicles, and there should boxes placed around the detected obstacles. \n\n## Checking the Rubric\n\nIf your project works correctly and you are happy with the results, carefully look at the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2529/view). If you feel like all the criteria from the rubric are met, you are ready to submit!\n\n## Submitting the Project\n\nYou can submit your project using the \"SUBMIT PROJECT\" button in the terminal below. If you are developing the project locally, and you would prefer to submit using a .zip file or Github repo, proceed to the next concept.",
